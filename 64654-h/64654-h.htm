<p>It was in May, 1869, that Mr. Bentham in his
presidential address to the Linnean Society called
attention to the want of reliable information as to
the existence of such subterranean accumulations of
seeds as are popularly supposed to account for the
sudden appearance on railway cuttings, gravel from
deep pits, and the like, of crops of weeds hitherto
unknown in a district.</p>

<p>He suggested that it might repay the trouble if
some accurate observers were to take this in hand,
and investigate the matter both by examining samples
of undisturbed soil taken from various depths,&mdash;when,
if any seeds of moderate size were present and undecomposed,
it would be tolerably easy to distinguish
them,&mdash;and also by ascertaining what means of
transport exist by which seeds may be scattered
over exposed surfaces, and thus explain the difficulty
without having recourse to hypothetical supplies of
sound though long-buried seeds.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> M. Kerner of Innspruck has lately adduced some facts bearing on the
question of the transport of seeds by the wind, having examined the collections
of animal and vegetable substances found on the icy surfaces of glaciers
and the plants growing on moraines. Judging from the facts thus obtained,
he attributes but a small influence to this agency, as the specimens discovered
belonged to the fauna and flora of the immediate vicinity, and not
one of these specimens must needs have come from a distance. See abstract
of his paper in Gardener's Chronicle, Feb. 3, 1872, p. 143, and in 'Nature' for
June 27, 1872, p. 164.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[ 4 ]</a></span></p></div>

<p>As I listened, the question occurred to me whether
the ants, which I had observed carrying seeds to their
nests at Mentone, might not be unconscious agents
on a small scale, both in the distribution and the
subterranean storing of seeds. When at a later
time I made this suggestion to some of our leading
naturalists, I learned with considerable surprise that
the unanimous opinion of our highest modern authorities
on the subject is opposed to the belief that
European ants ever do systematically collect and
make provision of seeds, and that the instances of
such occurrences in tropical climates remain as isolated
though undoubted facts which it is difficult to explain.</p>

<p>I was not then aware that towards the middle of
last century the ancient belief, dating from the time
of Solomon, that ants habitually show forethought
and husbandry in the collection of supplies of seeds
and grain had begun to be called in question, and
that our most able observers, such as Huber, Gould,
Kirby and Spence, and at the present day Mr.
Frederick Smith, had by close scrutiny of the habits
of these creatures proved that, wherever personal
investigation had enabled them to put the matter
to proof, no trace of harvesting was found.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> I have myself on many occasions thrown seeds in the track of the common
English ants, and my experience was, up to the past summer (1872),
similar to that of the above-named naturalists, but I have lately, by the
merest chance, become acquainted with a curious exception to this rule. It
happened as follows. I was gathering some fresh capsules of the common
sweet violet in a garden at Richmond, near London, and in pouring the seeds
out of my hand into the paper bag made to receive them, a few were spilled
on the ground. In a short time afterwards I was greatly surprised to see
some of these spilled seeds in motion, being carried by the common black
ant (<i>Formica nigra</i>) into its nest. On seeing this I hastened to get some
more fresh violet seeds, and also a quantity of seeds taken from ant's
granaries at Mentone, and scattered these where the other seeds had lain.
After watching for half an hour a few of the violet seeds were carried in, but
not one of the granary seeds was removed, though these were examined
with some curiosity. I repeated this experiment twice afterwards on a distinct
colony of ants of the same kind and obtained exactly the same result.
I opened the nest of the former colony on the day after they had carried in
the seeds, but failed to find these or any stores of other seeds.
</p>
<p>
I am inclined to think that the ants took these seeds believing them to be
larv&aelig; of other ants which they might eat; for fresh seeds of violet are not
very unlike the larv&aelig; of certain ants, as, for example, those of <i>Atta barbara</i>,
figured at <a href="#Plate_I">Plate I.</a>, Fig. E., p. 21, the semi-transparent membranous appendage
partly concealing the seed and giving it a fleshy appearance.
</p>
<p>
I think this the more likely because on two occasions the seeds which had
been carried into the nest were subsequently thrown out by the ants, which
had I believe discovered their mistake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[ 5 ]</a></span></p></div>

<p>However, just as the ancient writers, judging from
their own experience and from the reports of others,
had erred in attributing to ants in general the habit
of seed-storing possessed by certain species commonly
found in the south, so have modern naturalists fallen
into the mistake of denying it to any of the European
species.</p>

<p>The older authors who lived in Greece and Italy,
and the medi&aelig;val authors who drew their information
in great measure from the former, being familiar
with the fact that some ants habitually collect large
supplies of seed, went so far as to assert, or to imply,
that all European ants do so; the authors of the
present day, on the other hand, generalizing too
freely from their experience of ants found near their
northern homes, maintained and maintain the very
reverse.</p>

<p>So long as Europe was taught natural history by
southern writers the belief prevailed; but no sooner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[ 6 ]</a></span>
did the tide begin to turn, and the current of information
to flow from north to south, than the story
became discredited.</p>

<p>It is interesting now to recall a few of the allusions
to the harvesting ants made by ancient authors, some
of which contain tolerably accurate accounts of what
was to them a familiar sight or a universally accepted
fact.</p>

<p>The passages in Proverbs<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> are the following: "Go
to the ant, thou sluggard: consider her ways and be
wise; which, having no guide, overseer, or ruler, provideth
her meat in the summer, and gathereth her
food in the harvest." "The ants are a people not
strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer."
Hesiod<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> speaks of the time</p>

<p class="tdc">"When the provident one (the ant) harvests the grain."</p>

<p>Horace<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> also alludes to the foresight of the ant, who is

the Trojans hastening their departure to harvesting
ants, and the passage has been thus rendered by
Dryden:&mdash;</p>

<p>Indeed, it would seem that among the people inhabiting
the shores of the Mediterranean it was
almost as common to say "as provident as an ant"
as it is with us to say "as busy as a bee." Plautus<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>

<p>Any one who has seen the eagerness with which
certain southern ants seize upon seeds thrown in their
path will appreciate the correctness of this simile.</p>

<p>Claudius &AElig;lianus, who lived in the time of Hadrian,
gives a detailed account of the habits which he attributes
to ants,<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> from which the following is a translation:
"In summer time, after harvest, while the ears
are being threshed the ants pry about in troops around
the threshing floors, leaving their homes, and going
singly, in pairs, or sometimes three together. They
then select grains of wheat or barley, and go straight
home by the way they came. Some go to collect,
others to carry away the burden, and they avoid the
way for one another with great politeness and consideration,
especially the unburdened for the weight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[ 8 ]</a></span>
carriers. Now these excellent creatures, when they
have returned home, and stored their granaries with
wheat and barley, bore through each grain of seed in
the middle; that which falls off in the process becomes
a meal for the ants, and the remainder is unfertile.
This these worthy housekeepers do, lest when the
rains come the seeds should sprout, as they would
do if left entire, and thus the ants should come to
want. So we see that the ants have good share in
the gifts of nature, in this respect as well as others."
Further on<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> he gives a very interesting account of
their mode of collecting and preparing the grain,
many details of which I can myself substantiate from
personal observation, though I have never seen ants
actually at work upon the ears of corn. "But when
the ants start a foraging, they follow the biggest, who
take the lead as generals. And when they come to
the crops, the younger ones stand under the stalk,
but the leaders ascending gnaw through the culms,
as they are called [&#8000;&#965;&#961;&#945;&#947;&#959;&#8017;&#962;, 'the stalk ends on which
the ears grow' (Lid. and Scott, Gr. Lex.)], probably
meaning that they detach the separate spikelets of
which the ears are composed], of the ears [&#954;&#945;&#961;&#960;&#7985;&#956;&#969;&#957;],
which they throw to the people below. These busy
themselves with cutting away the chaff and peeling
off the envelopes which contain and cover the grain.
So the ants, though they need no threshing time, nor
men to winnow for them, nor an artificial draught of
wind to separate corn and chaff, yet have the food of
men who both plough and sow for it." &AElig;lian appears
also to have heard reports of the habits of ants in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[ 9 ]</a></span>
tropical countries, for he says,<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> "Certainly the Indian
ant is also a wise creature.... They leave one opening
at the top (of the nest), by which they have their
exits and entrances, when they come bearing the seeds
which they collect." I have never myself found seeds
bored through the centre in the way recorded above,
but it is possible that different species of ants may
treat the seeds in other ways than those observed by
me; or, on the other hand, &AElig;lian may have mistaken
the gnawing off the radicle of the seed, a process which
I shall describe from personal observation below, and
imagined that the seed itself was pierced.</p>

<p>Aldrovandus, writing in the sixteenth century,

"illud principium seu acumen grani, &egrave; quo germen
emitti &agrave; tritico solet"&mdash;that is to say, the radicle. But it
is not clear whether Aldrovandus treats of what he has
himself seen or refers to the account given by a certain
Bishop, Simon Mariolus, who, he says "in his
most pleasant and learned work, introduces a philosopher
as taking his walks abroad and examining an
ant's nest with its seed store," &amp;c.</p>

<p>The lively fable of the ant and the grasshopper, as
related by La Fontaine, has done much towards familiarizing
and keeping alive in the minds of many of
us the idea that ants habitually provide stores against
the winter; but we must not infer from this narration
that the witty French author had ever cared to examine
for himself whether the fable, which he borrowed
from &AElig;sop, had its foundation in fact or not. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[ 10 ]</a></span>
following translation from, the Greek original<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> bears in
a much higher degree the impress of personal and accurate
observation.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_12" id="Footnote_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> For this translation and all the foregoing extracts from ancient and

Once in winter time the ants were sunning their seed-store
which had been soaked by the rains. A grasshopper
saw them at this, and being famished and
ready to perish, he ran up and begged for a bit. To
the ant's question, "What were you doing in summer,
idling, that you have to beg now?" he answered, "I
lived for pleasure then, piping and pleasing travellers."
"O, ho!" said they, with a grin, "dance in winter,
if you pipe in summer. Store seed for the future when
you can, and never mind playing and pleasing travellers."<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
It would be easy to multiply instances
in which the older authors allude to this habit, but
enough have been given to afford a sample of what
may easily be found repeated elsewhere, and I will
now quote a few instances which illustrate the more
modern belief, utterly opposed to that so long maintained
by the ancients.</p>

<p>Messrs. Kirby and Spence<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> discuss the matter in
the following terms:&mdash;"When we find the writers of
all nations and ages unite in affirming that, having
deprived it of the power of vegetating, ants store up
grain in their nests, we feel disposed to give larger
credit to their assertions. Writers in general have taken
... (this) ... for granted. But when observers of nature
began to examine the manners and economy of these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[ 11 ]</a></span>
creatures more narrowly, it was found, at least with
respect to the European species of ants, that no such
hoards of grain were made by them; and, in fact, that
they had no magazines in their nests in which provisions
of any kinds were stored up."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_14" id="Footnote_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> Entomology, ed. 7 (1856), p. 313.</p></div>

<p>They then proceed to explain how easily the white
pup&aelig;, which the ants carry about in their jaws, may
have been mistaken for grains of wheat, and to inform
us that the accurate observations of Mr. Gould, published
in 1747, were among the first which led to the
correction of this error. "However," they continue,
"it may be otherwise with exotic ants, for although
during the cold of our winters they are generally
torpid and need scarcely any food, yet in warmer
regions, during the rainy seasons, when they are probably
confined to their nests, a store of provisions may
be necessary for them."</p>

<p>The author of the article on ants in Smith's Dictionary
of the Bible says, in reference to the assertion
that ants store seed, that "observation of the habits
of ants does not confirm this belief."</p>

<p>Latreille<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> denies it in the following emphatic terms:
"N'attribuons pas &agrave; la fourmi une pr&eacute;voyance inutile:
engourdie pendant l'hiver, pourquoi formeroit elle des
greniers pour cette saison?"</p>

<p>Huber again throws the weight of his great authority
into the scale against the ants, when he says,<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> "I
am naturally led to speak in this place of the manner
in which ants subsist in the winter, since we have
relinquished the opinion that they amass wheat and
other grain, and that they gnaw the corn to prevent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[ 12 ]</a></span>
it from germinating." He then goes on to show how
the ants are frequently torpid during the winter, and
that when it happens that a few warmer days wake
them up to life, they can always find a few aphides
also on the alert; for, strange to say, the same degree
of warmth which rouses the ants calls forth the aphides
also. It would appear that ants in the northern parts
of Europe feed on the honey-dew of aphides, and on
animal matter when they can get it; and up to the
present time the belief prevails among our modern
naturalists that they are limited to the same diet in
all parts of Europe.</p>

<p>It is now well known, however, that exceptions
must probably be made in tropical countries, for the
observations of Lieut.-Col. Sykes<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and Dr. Jerdon<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
have shown that many ants in India collect
grain in large quantities, robbing the crops and
plants cultivated in gardens, and even stealing seeds
put away in drawers, the inference being that they
employ them for food. The same observers have recorded
how the ants may be seen after wet weather
bringing out the grain to dry in the sun.</p>

<p>It seems strange that while travellers have reported
the seed-storing habits of ants in far distant countries,
our naturalists at home should have not only remained
unaware of its existence in Europe, but even strenuously
denied it. It is certain, however, that naturalists and
others in southern Europe are more or less aware of the
fact, but I have been unable to learn that any accurate
account of the habits of harvesting ants has hitherto
been published, or that any one has taken pains to
discover what becomes of the seed so laboriously
obtained.</p>

<p>It is true that in the <i>Enciclopedia Popolare</i><a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> extracts
are given from the remarks made by M. Gen&eacute;<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> on
the subject, in which he assumes that the fact that
ants collect and carry to their nest large supplies of
grain and seed is well known, but states that he is at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[ 14 ]</a></span>
a loss to conceive how they employ them, unless it
may be that they use them as materials for the construction
of their galleries, for they cannot eat such
hard substances, all their food being either liquid or
of the nature of juices, "gli alimenti sono sempre
materie liquide o materie sugose. Quanto ai corpi duri
e secchi che le formiche raccolgono, io non so altrimenti
riguardarli che come materiali di costruzione." It will
be understood, I think, from what has gone before, that
thus far nothing has really been ascertained as to the
exact state of the case; for though the Italian author
just quoted was aware that certain ants in the Mediterranean
region do store seed, his knowledge went no
further. Nor am I aware that any French author has
published an account of this habit and its object; and
in a recent abundantly illustrated volume founded on
a work by M. Emile Blanchard, I find, on the contrary,
the following very emphatic denial of its existence:&mdash;"The
curious idea which appears to have commenced
in very remote times, and to have been carried down
by tradition, and which was assisted by the results of
careless observations, concerning the habits of the
ants in collecting and storing up provisions, as it were
under the influence of a wise foresight, is evidently
incorrect."<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> There was, therefore, clearly an opening
here for close observation, and this I determined to do
my best to supply.</p>

<p>When I set out again from England in October,
1871, on my way to Mentone, I had obtained an idea
of some of the leading points which needed to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[ 15 ]</a></span>
cleared up, and I was greatly encouraged in my
attempt by the interest expressed in the subject by
several of our leading naturalists, among whom I
may especially mention Mr. Frederick Smith.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_24" id="Footnote_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> am very greatly indebted to Mr. Smith for much kind assistance, and
especially for having named the specimens which I collected.</p></div>

<p>Plainly the first thing to do was to determine
whether the seeds which I had watched the ants
carry to their nests were separately stored in subterranean
granaries, as they would be if the ant really
provides for the future; or whether they were merely
strewed here and there, or used as building materials.</p>

<p>Next I must, if possible, obtain conclusive evidence
as to the use to which the ants put the seeds thus
collected; whether they eat them or turn them to
some other account. Again I must observe whether
the seed-collecting ants also search for aphides, and
what other kinds of food they obtain. Then another
very interesting question remained&mdash;namely, whether
all southern ants uniformly collect seed, and to the
same extent, or whether the habit is peculiar to
certain species.</p>

<p>These, and many other subjects of inquiry connected
with them, readily suggested themselves to
my mind, and it will now be my endeavour to show
how far I have been able to throw light upon
them.</p>

<p>The habits recorded in the following pages refer
exclusively, unless special notice is given to the
contrary, to <i>Atta barbara</i>, the black ant represented
on <a href="#Plate_I">Plate I.</a> We have, as far as I am aware, only
four <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> harvesting ants on the Riviera&mdash;namely,
<i>Atta barbara</i> under two forms, the one wholly black
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[ 16 ]</a></span>
the other red-headed; <i>Atta structor</i>, a creature very
similar to <i>barbara</i>, but of a claret-brown colour; and
a minute yellow ant, the large workers of which have
gigantic heads, named <i>Pheidole</i> (or <i>Atta</i>) <i>megacephala</i>.</p>

<p>My renewed observations at Mentone were carried
on from October, 1871, to May, 1872, and I was
able during that interval to become a frequent
visitor to a warm and sheltered valley, which lay but
a few minutes' walk from the house in which I lived,
and in which thirty nests of the most active of the
seed-storing ants were to be found.</p>

<p>Full therefore of my intention to resolve this
difficulty if possible, I set out on October 29, 1871,
immediately after my return to Mentone, to revisit
this valley, where, in the previous May, I had seen
the ants busily engaged in cutting, carrying, and
sorting their harvest.</p>

<p>The spot in question was a rough slope of soft
sandstone rock, with accumulations of sandy soil in
the hollows, covered with a sparse and scrubby
vegetation, composed of <i>Cistus</i> (<i>C. salvifolius</i>), pot-herb
thyme, black lavender (<i>Lavandula st&aelig;chas</i>),
spiny broom (<i>Calycotome spinosa</i>), overshadowed here
and there by a few scattered stone and maritime
pines, and intermixed with coarse grasses and some
smaller plants.</p>

<p>Cultivated lemon terraces lay on the edge of the
wild ground lower down in the valley, and at this
season, as also in the late spring, these terraces were
overgrown with a rank crop of weeds, most of which
were in seed.</p>

<p>I had scarcely set foot on the <i>garrigue</i>, as this kind
of wild ground is called, to distinguish it from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[ 17 ]</a></span>
meadows or terraced land, before I was met by a long
train of ants, forming two continuous lines, hurrying
in opposite directions, the one with their mouths full,
the others with their mouths empty.</p>

<p>It was easy enough to find the nest to which these
ants belonged, for it was only necessary to follow
the line of ants burdened with seeds, grain, or entire
capsules, which had their heads turned homewards,
and there, sure enough, at about ten yards distance,
and partly shaded by some small <i>Cistus</i> bushes,
lay the nest, to and from the entrances of which
the incessant stream of incomers and outgoers kept
flowing.</p>

<p>The proceedings of the ants were the same as those
previously observed in the late spring (April and
May), the workers usually seeking their harvest at
some distance from the nest, and going in search of
it as far as the cultivated ground, where the crops of
weeds were more abundant and more varied.</p>

<p>In a few cases, however, where the terraces were too
far distant, they contented themselves with plundering
the grasses, pea-flowers, honeywort, and the other
denizens of the garrigue. In one case I was able to
follow the thread-like column of workers from the
nest to the weedy terrace where the plants grew from
which they were gathering the seeds, and found that
the nearly continuous double line measured twenty-four
yards. Even this gives but an inadequate idea
of the number of ants actively employed in the
service of this colony, for hundreds of them were
dispersed among the weeds on the terrace, and many
were also employed in sorting the materials and in
attending to the internal economy of the nest. Still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[ 18 ]</a></span>
this affords some evidence of the systematic and
extensive scale on which foraging is carried on by
this ant, and of the high importance which these
creatures attach to their provision of grain.</p>

<p>It is not a little surprising to see that the ants
bring in not only seeds of large size and fallen grain,
but also green capsules, the torn stalks of which
show that they have been freshly gathered from the
plant. The manner in which they accomplish this
feat is as follows. An ant ascends the stem of a
fruiting plant, of Shepherd's-purse (<i>Capsella Bursa
pastoris</i>) let us say, and selects a well-filled but green
pod about midway up the stem, those below being ready
to shed their seeds at a touch. Then, seizing it in
its jaws, and fixing its hind legs firmly as a pivot,
it contrives to turn round and round, and so strain
the fibres of the fruit-stalk that at length they snap.
It then descends the stem, patiently backing and
turning upwards again as often as the clumsy and
disproportionate burden becomes wedged between the
thickly set stalks, and joins the line of its companions
on their way to the nest. In this manner capsules of
chickweed (<i>Alsine media</i>) and entire calyces, containing
the nutlets of Calaminth, are gathered; two ants
also sometimes combine their efforts, when one stations
itself near the base of the peduncle and gnaws it at the
point of greatest tension, while the other hauls upon
and twists it. I have never seen a capsule severed from
its stalk by cutting alone, and the mandibles of this ant
are perhaps incompetent to perform such a task. I
have occasionally seen ants engaged in cutting the
capsules of certain plants drop them and allow their
companions below to carry them away; and this corresponds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[ 19 ]</a></span>
with the curious account given by &AElig;lian<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> of the
manner in which the spikelets of corn are severed and
thrown down "to the people below," &#964;&#969; &#948;&#7969;&#956;&#969; &#954;&#7937;&#964;&#969;..</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_25" id="Footnote_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> Vide supra, <a href="#Page_8">p. 8</a>.</p></div>

<p>If the incoming and weight-carrying column of
ants be closely examined it will be found that though
the great majority of workers are bringing seeds in
some form to the nest, a few are burdened with other
and more miscellaneous materials.</p>

<p>Occasionally one or two may be detected carrying
a dead insect, or crushed land-shell, the corolla of a
flower, a fragment of stick, or leaf, but I have never
seen aphides brought in to the nest or visited by this
ant or by <i>Atta structor</i>.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens that an ant has manifestly
made a bad selection, and is told on its return that
what it has brought home with much pains is no
better than rubbish, and is hustled out of the nest,
and forced to throw its burden away. In order to
try whether these creatures were not fallible like
other mortals, I one day took out with me a little
packet of grey and white porcelain beads, and scattered
these in the path of a harvesting train. They
had scarcely lain a minute on the earth before one
of the largest workers seized upon a bead, and with
some difficulty clipped it with its mandibles and
trotted back at a great pace to the nest. I waited
for a little while, my attention being divided between
the other ants who were vainly endeavouring to
remove the beads, and the entrance down which the
worker had disappeared, and then left the spot. On
my return in an hour's time, I found the ants passing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[ 20 ]</a></span>
unconcernedly by and over the beads which lay
where I had strewn them in apparently undiminished
quantities; and I conclude from this that they had
found out their mistake, and had wisely returned to
their accustomed occupations.</p>

<p>I have often amused myself by strewing hemp
and canary seed or oats, all of which form heavy
burdens for the ants, near their nests; and it is a
curious sight to watch the eagerness and determination
with which they will drag them away. It is
interesting also to note how on the following day
the husks of these seeds will appear on the rubbish-heap,
or sometimes, after a shower of rain, they will
be brought out by the ants with the point of the
little root (the radicle or fibril as the case may be)
gnawed off (see Figs. A, B, C, <a href="#Plate_VI">Plate VI.</a>, p. 35).</p>

<p>It frequently happens that on the wild hillside the
position of a nest of <i>Atta barbara</i> is indicated by the
presence of a number of plants growing on or round
the kitchen midden, which are properly weeds of cultivation,
and strangers to the cistus- and lavender-covered
banks of the garrigue. These have sprung
from seeds accidentally dropped by the ants, and which
they had obtained from the lemon terraces. Thus
when you see little patches of ground from one to
three feet long and broad, covered with such plants as
fumitory (<i>Fumaria</i>), oats (<i>Avena</i>), nettles (<i>Urtica membranacea</i>),
four species of <i>Veronica</i>, chickweed (<i>Alsine
media</i>), goosefoot (<i>Chenopodium</i>), <i>Rumex Bucephalephorus</i>,
wild marigold (<i>Calendula arvensis</i>), <i>Antirrhinum
Orontium</i>, <i>Linaria simplex</i>, and <i>Cardamine hirsuta</i>, you
may confidently expect to find a colony of these ants
close at hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[ 21 ]</a></span></p>

<p>These plants are sometimes found along the sides
of miniature gullies and crevices in the rock, where
they have been washed by little runlets of water formed
in seasons of heavy rain, and thus these interloping
plants are occasionally dispersed and brought into
competition with the rightful occupiers of the ground.</p>

<p><i>Atta structor</i> and <i>A. barbara</i> do not employ any
materials in the construction of their nest, simply
excavating it out of the earth itself, or occasionally
out of the sandy rock, and the large mounds, in great
part composed of vegetable matter, which may frequently
be found at the entrances of their nests, are
nothing more than the rubbish heaps and kitchen
middens of each establishment. These consist in part
of the earth pellets and grains of gravel which the
ants bring out from their nest when forming the subterranean
galleries, but principally of plant-refuse such
as the chaff of grasses, empty capsules, gnawed seed-coats,
and the like, which would occupy much space
if left inside the nest (see <a href="#Plate_I">Plate I.</a>, Fig. A.). While an
army of workers are employed in seeking and bringing
in supplies, others are busy sorting the materials thus
obtained, stripping off all the useless envelopes of seed
or grain, and carrying them out to throw away.
Thanks to the unwearied activity with which this
divided labour is carried on the kitchen middens
speedily rise in the harvest season, and in places where
they are not exposed to the action of wind and rain,
often acquire a considerable size, so much so that
sometimes, if collected, one alone might fill a quart
tankard.</p>

<p>It was the sight of such a refuse mound, and an examination
of the materials which composed it,&mdash;many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[ 22 ]</a></span>
of which show that they were once parts of seeds, &amp;c.,
the albuminous contents of which had been extracted
through holes gnawed in the side,&mdash;that gave me the
conviction that large stores of seed must lie hidden
below in the nest; for if it were true, as some have
suggested, that the ants employ the grain and seeds
which they collect as materials for the construction of
their nest, they would certainly not reject such parts
as the chaff of grasses and the like, which are admirably
suited for the purpose, and are actually used for this
end by other species of ants.</p>

<p>It was therefore with the greatest confidence as to
the result that I opened the nests of <i>Atta barbara</i> in
search of granaries and seeds. My first attempt was
made upon a nest lying in a hollow where there was
a rather deep bed of soil, and the galleries extended
so far on either side and in a downward direction that,
though I removed enough soil to fill a wheelbarrow,
I failed to reach the arcana of the nest, and saw neither
chambers nor granaries.</p>

<p>Yet I frequently encountered workers carrying seeds
downwards along the subterranean passages. I then
selected a nest where the coarse and hard rock lay
much nearer to the surface, barring their downward
course, and compelling the ants to extend their nest in
a horizontal direction.</p>

<p>Here, almost at the first stroke, I came upon large
masses of seeds carefully stored in chambers prepared
in the soil. Some of these lay in long subcylindrical
galleries, and, owing to the presence in large quantities
of the black shining seeds of amaranth (<i>Amaranthus
Blitum</i>, &amp;c.), looked like trains of gunpowder laid
ready for blasting. Fig. A, <a href="#Plate_II">Plate II.</a> represents a trowelful
of earth taken from this nest, and lifted with care
so as to leave the seeds almost <i>in situ</i>. Others were
massed together in horizontal chambers, having a
concave roof and a flat and carefully prepared floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[ 23 ]</a></span></p>

<p>The texture of the floor usually differs markedly
from that of the surrounding soil, and the fine grains
of silex and mica which are selected for its construction
are more or less cemented together, so that the floor
will sometimes part, when dry, from the soil about it,
as caked and dry mud separates from a gravel path
(see <a href="#Plate_III">Plate III.</a>).</p>

<p>On carefully examining a quantity of the seeds, grain,
and minute dry fruits taken from the granaries, I found
that they had been gathered from the following plants:
fumitory (<i>Fumaria Capreolata</i>, &amp;c.), amaranth (<i>Amaranthus
Blitum</i>, &amp;c.), <i>Setaria</i>, and three other species of
grasses, honeywort (<i>Alyssum maritimum</i>), <i>Veronica</i>,
and from four unrecognised species, one of which was
a pea-flower. There were therefore in this nest seeds,
&amp;c., which had been taken from more than twelve
distinct species of plants, belonging to at least seven
separate families. The granaries lay from an inch and
a half to six inches below the surface and were all
horizontal. They were of various sizes and shapes, the
average granary being about as large as a gentleman's
gold watch.</p>

<p>I was greatly surprised to find that the seeds,
though quite moist, showed no trace of germination,
and this was the more astonishing as the self-sown
seeds of the same kinds as those detected here, such
as fumitory for instance, were then coming up abundantly
in gardens and on terraces. The seeds of
<i>Odontites lutea</i> afford a curious test of the presence of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[ 24 ]</a></span>
moisture in the granaries, and it will usually be found
that, when they are recently taken out of the nest,
they are of a greenish colour and semi-transparent horn-like
texture, which changes on exposure to the air
to a chalky white and opaque appearance, due to the
drying of the coat of the seed.</p>

<p>The fact of the sound condition of the seeds in
these granaries seemed to me so very strange
and difficult to explain that I determined to pay
special attention to the subject, and with this view
collected and carefully examined large quantities of
the grain and seeds taken at different times from the
stores of twenty-one distinct nests, the first of which
was opened on October 29th, and the last on May 5th.
In these twenty-one nests out of the thousands of
seeds taken I only found twenty-seven in seven nests
which showed trace of germination, and of these eleven
had been mutilated in such a way as to arrest their
growth. The sprouting seeds were found in the
months from November to February, while in the
nests opened in October, March, April, and May, no
sprouted seeds were discovered, though these latter
months are certainly highly favourable to germination.
It is therefore extremely rare to find other than sound
and intact seeds in the granaries, and we must conclude
that the ants exercise some mysterious power over
them which checks the tendency to germinate.</p>

<p>Apparently it is not that moisture or warmth or
the influence of atmospheric air is denied to the
seeds, for we find them in damp soil, in genial weather,
and often at but a trifling distance below the surface
of the ground; and I have proved that the vitality of
the seeds is not affected by raising crops of young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[ 25 ]</a></span>
plants, such as fumitory, pellitory, <i>Polygonum aviculare</i>,
and grasses, from seeds taken out of granaries.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_26" id="Footnote_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> This experiment was tried by me on two occasions, in the former case
the seeds were taken from a granary about four inches below the surface of
the ground, on November 10th, and sowed two days afterwards, and several
of these were up on Dec. 1st. The second trial was made on seeds found at
only one and a half inch below the surface, on Dec. 29th, 1871; these were
sowed in England on June 18th, 1872, and the young plants made their appearance
in large numbers ten days afterwards.</p></div>

<p>I have frequently remarked that it is the seeds last
collected before a fall of rain which are brought out
in a sprouting condition from the nest; for I have
observed in cases where I had recently scattered seeds
near wild nests, that it is these which are carried out
from the nest and placed to dry after a wet night; and
so in the case of a nest which I kept in captivity, when a
variety of different seeds had been successively supplied
to the ants, it was the cabbage, lettuce, and
chicory seeds, given the day before the nest was watered,
that reappeared after having been carried below, and
not the hemp, canary, and mixed seeds of wild plants
previously strewed on the nest. It seems possible
that the process, whatever it may be, to which the ants
subject the seeds which are to remain dormant may
require some time, and the construction of the granary
chambers is doubtless a long affair, so that when
unusually large supplies of grain, &amp;c., are brought in
by the workers some part of them may not find the
necessary accommodation and attention. When the
seeds do germinate in the nests, and it is my belief
that they are usually softened and made to sprout
before they are consumed by the ants, it is very curious
to see how the growth is checked in its earliest stage,
and how, after the radicle or fibril&mdash;the first growing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[ 26 ]</a></span>
root of dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous seeds&mdash;has
been gnawed off, they are brought out from the
nest and placed in the sun to dry, and then, after a
sufficient exposure, carried below into the nest.</p>

<p>The seeds are thus in effect malted, the starch
being changed into sugar, and I have myself witnessed
the avidity with which the contents of seeds
thus treated are devoured by the ants.</p>

<p>Figs. A, B, C, in <a href="#Plate_VI">Plate VI.</a>, p. 35, illustrate the manner
in which the ants mutilate the germinating seeds and
check their growth. Thus, at Fig. C 2 of <a href="#Plate_VI">Plate VI.</a> a
sprouting but uninjured canary seed (<i>Phalaris canariensis</i>)
is drawn, magnified, and at Figs. C and C 1 the
same of the natural size and magnified, after the ants
have gnawed its fibril (fib.), which in this case pierces
the undeveloped radicle (rad.). Fig. A 2 represents a
sprouting hemp-seed, magnified,<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and Figs. A, A 1,
the same of the natural size and magnified, mutilated,
the tip of the radicle being removed.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_27" id="Footnote_27"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> Properly a nut, for it comprises the seed and the enveloping coat of the
ovary. The canary seed also, spoken of above, is a grain containing a seed.</p></div>

<p>At Figs. B, B 1, B 2, the same process is shown in
the case of a small wild pea.</p>

<p>It is, however, certain that though a few individual
seeds may sprout in the nests from time to time either
with or without the concurrence of the ants, the great
mass remain for many weeks, or even months, quite
intact, neither decaying nor germinating, whereas every
one knows that if a quantity of seeds are placed in
the soil in a moist and warm place, all the seeds that
are of one kind will almost simultaneously begin to
grow after the lapse of a fixed interval.</p>

<p>Now if this took place in an ant's nest, the provisions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[ 27 ]</a></span>
would have to be rapidly consumed at stated periods
and to be frequently renewed; but this is not the case.
This is easily shown by an examination of the seeds
contained in the nests in April or May, many of which
will prove to belong to plants which fruit in the autumn
and are not to be found later than November. Thus, for
example, on May 5th at Cannes, I discovered nutlets of
<i>Cynoglossum pictum</i>, which can scarcely have been collected
later than the preceding October or November.
Besides, during the time from the middle of January
to the middle of March, scarcely a seed is collected
under ordinary circumstances, there being extremely
few wild plants in fruit at that season, and yet the
granaries will be found well filled if a nest is opened
at the end of this period.</p>

<p>A knowledge of the fact that ants in warm climates
accumulate large and very varied stores of seeds retaining
their power of germination, might at times be
of service to travellers, by enabling them to obtain,
by a stroke or two of the spade, an interesting collection
of the seeds and the seed-like fruits of the
country, when time and opportunity failed for obtaining
them in a more satisfactory manner. The
following list of plants, the grain, seeds, and small
dry fruits of which I have found in the subterranean
granaries of <i>Atta structor</i> and <i>A. barbara</i>, especially
the latter, shows that the ants probably collect
almost indiscriminately from any fruiting plant
that falls in their way.</p>

<p>Fumitory (<i>Fumaria</i>, three species), honeywort
(<i>Alyssum maritimum</i>), narrow-leaved sun rose (<i>Fumaria
viscida</i> and <i>F. Spachii</i>), <i>Oxalis corniculata</i>, <i>Silene</i>, <i>Linum
gallicum</i>, mallow (<i>Lavatera cretica</i>?), medick (<i>Medicago</i>),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[ 28 ]</a></span>
wild lentil (<i>Ervum</i>), spiny broom (<i>Cytisus spinosus</i>),
<i>Valerianella carinata</i>, <i>Centaurea aspera</i>, <i>Odontites lutea</i>,
<i>Calamintha Nepeta</i>, <i>Polygonum convolvulus</i> and <i>P. aviculare</i>,
amaranth (<i>Amaranthus Blitum</i> and <i>patulus</i>), pellitory
(<i>Parietaria</i>), <i>Euphorbia</i>, pine (<i>Pinus</i>), wild sarsaparilla
(<i>Smilax aspera</i>), <i>Setaria verticillata</i> and <i>S. italica</i>, <i>Andropogon
Isch&aelig;mum</i>, and of eight other plants of which
I do not recognise the seeds. This list, comprising
plants belonging to eighteen distinct families, might
be greatly prolonged if I were to add to it the names
of the seeds which I have seen the ants carry towards
their nests, but have not actually detected in the
granaries. Thus I have seen trains of ants burdened
with the long-beaked, spirally-twisted fruits of crane's
bill (<i>Erodium</i>), and, as above mentioned, with capsules
of chickweed (<i>Alsine media</i>) and shepherd's-purse
(<i>Capsella Bursa pastoris</i>), with whole orange pips, and
even haricot beans, seeds of the New Zealand veronica
(<i>V. Andersonii</i>), of <i>Silene pseudoatocion</i>, and many other
garden plants, also with nutlets of the plane tree and
seeds of the cypress.</p>

<p>Pliny mentions<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> incidentally having watched the
ants carrying away cypress seeds, and comments upon
the fact that so small a creature should be able to
interfere with the growth of such a noble tree.</p>

<p>I have little doubt that the seed stores of the ants
in botanic and other gardens, where rare plants are
cultivated in southern Europe and in warm climates
generally, contain samples taken from the fruits of a
great many of the rarer and more interesting species
as well as of the weeds and native plants. Indeed I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[ 29 ]</a></span>
have been told that this is the case by my friend Dr.
Bornet, who complains of the depredations committed
by the ants in the gardens of the Villa Thuret, at
Antibes. They go so far as to plunder the seed bags
which are hung from the branches of the trees and
shrubs, unless these are securely closed and tied with
string; they carry off wholesale the grass and anemone
seeds,<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> which are scattered when the lawns are resown;
and Dr. Bornet has seen the seeds of <i>Acacia retinoides</i>
lie heaped up by the handful at the entrances of their
nests, and disappear below after a few hours.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_29" id="Footnote_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> Properly grass grain and anemone achenes.</p></div>

<p>M. Germain de St. Pierre has observed similar facts
at Hy&egrave;res, where he has detected large stores of cereals
in the granaries of the ants, and considers that the
robberies committed by these creatures are sufficient
in extent to cause a serious loss to cultivators.</p>

<p>It is difficult to estimate the amount of seed stored
in a single nest by a colony of ants both on account
of the extent of these nests, and because of the number
of seeds which are always lost in digging. The nests
themselves also vary greatly in size. Perhaps I shall
not be very far from the mark however, if I conjecture
that average-sized nests contain during the winter
months about half a pint of seeds.</p>

<p><i>Atta structor</i> is more frequently found near houses
and in gardens than <i>A. barbara</i>, the latter usually
living on wild ground adjoining cultivation. There
was a flourishing colony of <i>structor</i> in the main street
of Mentone, cleverly placed at the lintel of the door of
a corn chandler's store, where they were ever on the
look out for stray grains of oats and wheat, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[ 30 ]</a></span>
might chance to fall from the sacks. Another nest, in a
different part of the town, got its principal subsistence
from the grains of canary seed, which were scattered
by the birds occupying a cage hanging outside a shop
window at a little distance.</p>

<p>The granaries of <i>A. structor</i> are arranged in the same
way as those of <i>A. barbara</i>, and may, in like manner, be
found stored with seeds, and lying at depths below the
surface, varying from one to twenty inches.</p>

<p>A diagram is given in the preceding woodcut
of a vertical section of a nest of <i>barbara</i> lying in soil
sixteen inches deep, the granaries being at 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>, 2, 4,
6, 9, and 12<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inches, as determined by actual measurement
on the spot.</p>

<p>In some cases, and especially where the soil is
shallow, the galleries and granaries are much crowded
together, as is shown in <a href="#Plate_IV">Plate IV.</a>, which represents a
small mass of earth, pierced by the roots of plants,
taken out of a nest of <i>barbara</i>, lying at two inches
below the surface. When first opened all these
granaries were filled with seeds.</p>

<p>The shape of the granary chambers varies considerably,
as may be seen by reference to the drawing
of three floors given in <a href="#Plate_III">Plate III.</a>, p. 23, and that
shown diagrammatically in the woodcut on next page,
where the white space represents the granary floor,
and the dark circular spot in the centre, the aperture
of a gallery leading downwards.</p>

<p>I once had an opportunity of seeing a large portion
of a nest of the red-headed variety of <i>barbara</i> laid bare
by a cutting recently made through a bank at Cannes in
digging the foundations of a house, which exposed
a very extensive and complicated series of galleries and
granaries. The lowest point at which I detected the
workings of the ants was at twenty inches below the
surface of the ground, and here granaries containing
seeds in abundance were present, and the galleries and
granaries extended over a space measuring 5ft. 9in. in
a horizontal direction. In two cases I have found
nests of <i>Atta barbara</i> at Mentone which were carried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[ 32 ]</a></span>
far into the living rock in places where it happened to
be of an even grain, and not gritty or pebbly as it frequently
is. It was quite by chance that I first discovered
this very interesting fact, having tracked a
train of seed-bearing workers to a part of the sandstone
rock where steps had quite recently been hacked
out leading to some terraces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[ 33 ]</a></span></p>

<p>I soon saw that the ants entered and came out from
three or four small passages in the cleft surface of the
rock, and that their nest actually lay in the sandstone
itself. Having contrived to wedge off several large
flakes of the rock, which was soft in most places and
might be scooped out with a strong knife, I discovered
that though some of the passages of the ants followed
the lines of cleavage and the cracks made by the fine wiry
fibres of the bushes growing on the surface, others were
frequently made in the form of tubular tunnels through
the living rock. Without the aid of hammer and chisel
it was not possible to follow the galleries and to
secure specimens of the mined rock; but on the next
day (Dec. 7th) I returned armed with tools, and with
the assistance of a friend<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> quarried out a portion of
the nest, tracing it down eventually to twenty-three
inches below the surface of the rock in a vertical, and
to about sixteen inches away from the surface in a
horizontal direction.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_30" id="Footnote_30"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30"><span class="label">[30]</span></a> I take this opportunity of expressing my thanks to Mr. Robert
Lightbody for help on this and other occasions.</p></div>

<p>At one point where the rock was almost entirely
solid and without flaw or crevice, and where it was
clear that the passages were entirely the work of the
ants, we measured a tunnel by worming a straw down it,
and found it to be ten inches in length. We subsequently
traced this tunnel or rock gallery down until
it communicated with a chamber filled with winged ants
and seeds of several kinds. This granary was horizontal,
and merely an enlargement of an ordinary gallery
of a compressed spindle-shape, flattened from
above downwards, measuring as nearly as I could
estimate three inches in length, by a trifle less than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[ 34 ]</a></span>
an inch in breadth, and half an inch in height.
The walls were tolerably smooth, but not prepared or
glazed in the way that certain small terminal cells
which I shall shortly describe were. The surfaces,
however, had a very different appearance to that of
the surrounding sandstone, being of a darker and
brownish colour, and seeming to be coated with some
kind of dressing or cement.</p>

<p>One of these tunnels at first took a horizontal course
for two and a half inches, then descended vertically for
an inch and a half to a point where it made two horizontal
branches, and from these latter several other
vertical galleries descended, two of which we were able
to trace until they expanded into a cluster of small pear-shaped
cells, the walls of which were quite smooth and
very carefully laid with plates of mica and cement. I
was able to draw this on the spot, Fig. A, <a href="#Plate_V">Plate V.</a>, while
Mr. Lightbody worked it out piecemeal with hammer
and chisel. It was unfortunately impossible to secure
more than very imperfect fragments as specimens.
These terminal cells were empty when we came to
them, but it is quite possible that the ants may have
conveyed away larv&aelig; or winged ants from them,
having received abundant notice of the coming danger
from the continued jarring of the chisel-work.</p>

<p>One entrance to this nest lay in a small accumulation
of soil in a hollow of the rock, and it was at this
point that the refuse from the nest was cast out. Indeed,
had it not been for the accidental circumstance of
my having traced the ants to the newly hewn step in the
sandstone, I might never have discovered the fact that
the nests are sometimes carried deep into the living rock.</p>


<div id="Plate_VI" class="fig_center" style="width: 378px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[ 35 ]</a></span></p>

<p>With this to guide me, however, I succeeded in finding
a second nest of the same kind, and here I was
able to secure better specimens of the tunnels for drawing
(Figs. B, B 1, <a href="#Plate_V">Plate V.</a>, p. 33). These drawings may
be taken as representing also the size and shape of
the tunnels in the former nest, which were for the
most part like these, beautifully cylindrical, as is shown
in the front view of the tunnel at B 1. In one nest
of <i>barbara</i> I found a curious hollow spherical dome,
about an inch in diameter, the walls of which were
constructed of hardened earth about two lines thick,
and having a large circular aperture at the top and a
very small one below (Figs. D and D 1, <a href="#Plate_VI">Plate VI.</a>). This
dome was imbedded below in earth which adhered
to it, but it was otherwise easily separable from the
soil; its inner walls were smoothed with great nicety.</p>

<p>It has been suggested to me that this spherical
chamber was originally the work of a scarab&aelig;us, which
had chanced to bury the ball containing its eggs close
to the nest of the ants, and that the latter had appropriated
it after the departure of the beetle grubs.
This may perhaps have been the case, but the dome
was rather larger than the ball usually formed by
the scarab beetle, and I have never seen one of
these balls surrounded by a hardened case. The
chamber thus constructed was employed as a granary,
and filled, as well as the adjacent passages, with the
grain of a grass (<i>Tragus racemosus</i>), still enclosed in the
husks, among which I detected several ants at work,
and also some minute white semi-transparent creatures,
like spring-tails (<i>Podurus</i>), which abound in these ants'
nests. Besides this spring-tail it is common to find in
the galleries and granaries of <i>Atta structor</i> and <i>A. barbara</i>,
certain silky yellowish-white "silver fish" (<i>Lepisma</i>),
a small white woodlouse which does not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[ 36 ]</a></span>
roll itself into a ball, and at times the larv&aelig; of an
elater beetle. I have observed on more than one
occasion that when in digging into an ant's nest I
have thrown out an elater larva, the ants would cluster
round it and direct it towards some small opening
in the soil, which it would quickly enlarge and disappear
down. At other times, however, the ants would
take no notice of the elater, and it is my belief that
the attentions paid to it on former occasions were
purely selfish, and that they intended to avail themselves
of the tunnel thus made down into the soil,
with a view of reopening communications with the
galleries and granaries concealed below, the approaches
to which had been covered up. I have frequently
watched the ants make use of these passages mined
by the elater on these occasions.</p>

<p>At one time I suspected that the elater larv&aelig;
might consume the seeds stored by the ants, and I
therefore confined some of them in a tumblerful of
earth and seeds; but at the end of three weeks,
though the larv&aelig; were strong and healthy-looking, I
could not detect that any of the seeds had been
touched, and even those which had sprouted remained
uninjured. I have searched in vain for the beetles
and staphylinid&aelig; which are known to inhabit certain
ant's nests. In one nest I found (on Dec. 28) a
quantity of small spherical, egg-like galls, slightly
larger than but resembling the fruit of <i>Fumaria
capreolata</i>, spotted with pink-brown on a yellowish or
greyish ground. There was a dark spot at the point
at which the mature insect would emerge, and one did
escape from the egg-like cocoon while I was watching,
and proved to be a <i>Cynips</i> of very small size, but
furnished with a terrible dart for puncturing its prey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[ 37 ]</a></span></p>

<p>It seems difficult to understand how it comes that
these galls are systematically placed among the
seeds, for it was evidently no chance occurrence, and
I can only conjecture that the worker ants may have
brought them in and stored them under the impression
that they were really seeds! Even ants make
mistakes, and of this I have given an example above
(<a href="#Page_19">p. 19</a>). Though I have frequently found colonies of
several distinct species of ants inhabiting nests made in
the earth traversed by the widespread galleries of <i>Atta
structor</i> and <i>barbara</i>, I have never detected any intermixture
of species in the chambers of a nest,<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> and but
rarely found even the galleries and entrance used in
common by more than one species. On one occasion
when opening a nest of <i>structor</i> I cut through a
colony of the tiny, large-headed, yellow ant <i>Pheidole
megacephala</i>, lying in the midst of, though distinct
from, the former. When, however, it chanced that
one of the <i>structors</i> fell from the crumbling earth
into the midst of the <i>Pheidoles</i>, it was curious to see
how fiercely it would be attacked, and with what
terrified speed it would scamper off, without attempting
any resistance, and often carrying two or three
<i>Pheidoles</i> hanging on to its legs.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_31" id="Footnote_31"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> Except in a few cases where I have seen one or two <i>structors</i> in nests of
<i>barbara</i> and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>, and in the curious instance to be mentioned below,
where one colony consisted of nearly equal parts of <i>structor</i>, <i>barbara</i>, and the
red-headed variety of <i>barbara</i>.</p></div>

<p>Accidentally in this way battles do sometimes take
place between ants of different species; but by far
the most savage and prolonged contests which I
have witnessed were those in which the combatants
belong to two different colonies of the same
species.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[ 38 ]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Atta barbara</i>, <i>Formica cruentata</i>, <i>F. erratica</i>, and especially
<i>Myrmica c&aelig;spitum</i> may sometimes be seen fighting
in this desperate fashion. Rival colonies of
<i>Myrmica c&aelig;spitum</i> often gather for the battle into
dense masses three or four inches deep, and the
place of conflict will be seen on the following day
strewn with the dead, and this though the majority
of the slain are carried off for food by the victors.</p>

<p>But the most singular contests are those which
are waged for seeds by <i>A. barbara</i>, when one colony
plunders the stores of an adjacent nest belonging to
the same species, the weaker nest making prolonged
though, for the most part, inefficient attempts to
recover their property.</p>

<p>In the case of the other species of ant which I
have watched fighting, the strife would last but a
short time&mdash;a few hours or a day&mdash;but <i>A. barbara</i> will
carry on the battle day after day and week after week.
I was able to devote a good deal of time to watching
the progress of a predatory war of this kind, waged
by one nest of <i>barbara</i> against another, and which
lasted for forty-six days, from Jan. 18 to March 4!</p>

<p>I cannot of course declare positively that no cessation
of hostilities may have taken place during
the time, but I can affirm that whenever I visited the
spot, and I did so on twelve days, or as nearly as
possible, twice a week, the scene was one of war
and spoliation such as that which I shall now
describe.</p>

<p>An active train of ants, nearly resembling an ordinary
harvesting train, led from the entrance of one
nest to that of another lower down the slope, and
fifteen feet distant; but on closer examination it
appeared that though the great mass of seed-bearers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[ 39 ]</a></span>
were travelling towards the upper nest, some few
were going in the opposite direction and making for
the lower. Besides this, at intervals, combats might
be seen taking place, one ant seizing the free end of a
seed carried by another, and endeavouring to wrench
it away, and then frequently, as neither would let go,
the stronger ant would drag seed and opponent towards
its nest. At times other ants would interfere
and seize one of the combatants and endeavour to
drag it away, this often resulting in terrible mutilations,
and especially in the loss of the abdomen,
which would be torn off while the jaws of the victim
retained their indomitable bull-dog grip upon the
seed. Then the victor might be seen dragging away
his prize, while its adversary, though now little more
than a head and legs, offered a vigorous though of
course ineffectual resistance. I frequently observed
that the ants during these conflicts would endeavour
to seize one another's antenn&aelig;, and that if this were
effected, the ant thus assaulted would instantly release
his hold, whether of seed or adversary, and
appear utterly discomfited. No doubt the antenn&aelig;
are their most sensitive parts, and injuries inflicted
on these organs cause the greatest pain.</p>

<p>It was not until I had watched this scene for some
days that I apprehended its true meaning, and discovered
that the ants of the upper nest were robbing
the granaries of the lower, while the latter tried to
recover the stolen seeds both by fighting for them and
by stealing seeds in their turn from the nest of their
oppressors. The thieves, however, were evidently
the stronger, and streams of ants laden with seeds
arrived safely at the upper nest, while close observation
showed that very few seeds were successfully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[ 40 ]</a></span>
carried on the reverse journey into the lower and
plundered nest.</p>

<p>Thus when I fixed my attention on one of these
robbed ants surreptitiously making its exit with the
seed from the thieves' nest, and having overcome the
opposition and dangers met with on its way, reaching
after a journey which took six minutes to accomplish,
the entrance to its own home, I saw that it was
violently deprived of its burden by a guard of ants
stationed there apparently for the purpose, one of
whom instantly started off and carried the seed all
the way back again to the upper nest.</p>

<p>This I saw repeated several times.</p>

<p>After March 4 I never saw any acts of hostility
between these nests, though the robbed nest was not
abandoned. In another case of the same kind, however,
where the struggle lasted thirty-one days, the
robbed nest was at length completely abandoned, and
on opening it I found all the granaries empty with one
single exception, and this one was pierced by the
matted roots of grasses and other plants, and must
therefore have been long neglected by the ants.
Strangely enough, not one of the seeds in this deserted
granary showed traces of germination.</p>

<p>No doubt some very pressing need is the cause of
these systematic raids in search of accumulations of
seeds, and there can be little doubt that the requirements
of distinct colonies of ants of the same species
are often different even at the same season and date.
Thus these warring colonies of ants were active on
many days when the majority of the nests were completely
closed; and I have even seen these robbers
staggering along, enfeebled by the cold, and in wind
and rain, when all other ants were safe below ground.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[ 41 ]</a></span>
It may be that unusual exertions are necessitated by
some exceptional demands made by the condition of
the larv&aelig; of the winged male and female ants, and I
have observed that these latter appear at very various
periods. Thus I have seen winged males and females
in the nests of <i>barbara</i> on November 10, December 6,
February 2, and March 10; and in those of <i>structor</i>
on February 23, 29, March 13, and April 6.</p>

<p>Though <i>structor</i> and <i>barbara</i> make seed collecting
the business of their lives, they will, at least in times
of scarcity, eagerly devour animal food if it happen to
fall in their way, and in the harvesting trains a few
ants may occasionally be seen carrying small dead insects
and the like. Once I threw a dead grasshopper
down close to a nest of <i>barbara</i>; it was immediately
seized upon, and&mdash;after strenuous efforts had been made
to dismember it above ground, some ants straining
back the legs and wings, while others rushed in to
gnaw at the muscles where the tension was greatest,&mdash;carried
down below. On the following morning the
wings of the grasshopper were to be seen on the
rubbish heap in front of the nest. Dead house-flies
and the larv&aelig; of bees or wasps were at times readily
devoured by my captive ants (<i>barbara</i>). I have also
seen large numbers of <i>structors</i> engaged in picking the
bones of a dead lizard, and was once a witness of the
following singular contest between a soft-bodied,
smooth, greyish caterpillar, exactly an inch in length,
and two medium-sized <i>barbara</i> ants. The ants were
mere pigmies in comparison of their prey, for as such
I believe they regarded the caterpillar, but they
gripped its soft body with set mandibles, showing
the most savage determination not to loose their hold.</p>

<p>When I first detected the group the war was being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[ 42 ]</a></span>
waged in a tuft of grass over one of the entrances to
the ants' nest, and the caterpillar was striding along
the leaves, or thrusting itself between the culms in
the hope to shake off or brush away its little persecutors.
From time to time the caterpillar would turn
viciously round and endeavour to pluck away its
assailants, but though it actually succeeded in stripping
off by means of its forelegs and mouth five of
the six legs of one of the ants which was within its
reach, they never once released their hold.</p>

<p>At length a chance movement of mine shook the
grass leaf on which they were, and ants and caterpillar
rolled together down a steep and rocky slope to
about four feet distant. They tumbled over and over
several times, but still the ants gripped their prey as
firmly as ever.</p>

<p>The last endeavour of the giant victim was to rub
off the ants by burrowing into the soil, but on uncovering
its retreat, I saw that their positions were still
the same. After watching this struggle for twenty
minutes, time failed me, and I returned home, carrying
with me, however, the combatants; and when on
my return I opened the box in which they were imprisoned,
these bull-dog ants were clinging with mandibles
locked as firmly as ever, and now as I write,
in death they are clinging still, drowned in a sea of
spirits of wine.</p>

<p>During the winter and spring I kept two colonies
of <i>barbara</i> captive in the house, placed in separate
glass jars, each of which might perhaps hold half a
gallon. The former of these colonies was taken on
December 18; but neither the queen ant nor larv&aelig;
were found, though there probably were larv&aelig; in some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[ 43 ]</a></span>
unexplored part of the nest, and the ants were always
restless and miserable, unceasingly trying to escape,
and dying in large numbers.</p>

<p>On February 12 I found that all these ants, though
abundantly supplied with seeds and all other kinds
of food, were dead. Two other colonies of ants,
however, which had been taken in a torpid state in
the masses of earth which formed part of the original
nest, were alive and well, though still torpid.</p>

<p>The second captive colony, taken on December
28, with the wingless queen ant and quantities of
larv&aelig;, formed a strong contrast with the previous
one. Here the ants at once set to work upon the
construction of galleries and safety places for the
larv&aelig; below the even surface of garden mould on
which I had placed them within the jar; for in this
case I did not attempt to preserve any portion of
their own nest. This was done at 3.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, and by
9 that evening I found the ants most busily at work,
having in less than six hours excavated eight deep
orifices leading to galleries below, and surrounded these
orifices by crater-like heaps, made of the earth pellets
which they had thrown out. I have observed somewhat
similar structures raised by <i>barbara</i> after the
nests have been closed on account of rain, and <i>structor</i>
frequently raises still more elaborate and distinct
craters, such as those represented at Fig. B, <a href="#Plate_II">Plate II.</a>,
p. 22 (reduced one-half).</p>

<p>On the following morning the openings were ten
in number, and the greatly increased heaps of excavated
earth showed that they must probably have
been at work all night. The amount of work done
in this short time was truly surprising, for it must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[ 44 ]</a></span>
be remembered that, eighteen hours before, the
earth presented a perfectly level surface, and the
larv&aelig; and ants, now housed below, found themselves
prisoners in a strange place, bounded by glass walls,
and with no exit possible.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the ants displayed extraordinary
intelligence in having thus at a moment's
notice devised a plan by which the superabundant
number of workers could be employed at one time
without coming in one another's way. The soil
contained in the jar was of course less than a tenth
part of that comprised within the limits of an ordinary
nest, while the number of workers was probably
more than a third of the total number belonging
to the colony. If therefore but one or two entrances
had been pierced in the soil, the workers would have
been for ever running against one another, and a
great number could never have got below to help in
the all-important task of preparing passages and
chambers for the accommodation of the larv&aelig;. These
numerous and funnel-shaped entrances admitted of
the simultaneous descent and ascent of large numbers
of ants, and the work progressed with proportionate
rapidity. After a few days only three entrances, and
eventually only one remained open. Yet for weeks
this active work went on, and the ants brought up
such quantities of earth from below that it became
difficult to prevent them from choking up the bottle
containing their water, which they repeatedly buried
up to the neck. On January 10 the surface of the
earth was raised from an inch and a half at its
lowest, to three inches at its highest point above
its original level, and this bulk of excavated earth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[ 45 ]</a></span>
represented the amount of space contained in their
galleries and chambers constructed below. It was
not, however, until nineteen days after their capture
that the ants began to form systematic trains to carry
down the seeds which I placed for them on the
surface, and I suppose that they had required this
time for the construction and consolidation of the
granary chambers. From this time forward the
ants came out repeatedly in greater or less force to
gather in the various seeds with which I supplied
them. Indeed, throughout the whole of their captivity
they seemed to be perfectly contented with their
lot and free from disease, remarkably few ants dying
or appearing feeble, and as far as the limited space
would permit they reproduced most of the habits
which I had noted as belonging to them in a wild
state, such as the formation of a rubbish heap;
bringing out refuse materials, gnawed and empty
seed-coats, the ends of radicles, and root fibres which
had penetrated their nest, and laying sprouted seeds
in the air to dry after having gnawed off the radicle
in order to arrest their growth.</p>

<p>I was also in this way able to see for myself much
that I otherwise could not have seen. Thus I was
able to watch the operation of removing roots which
had pierced through their galleries, belonging to
seedling plants growing on the surface, and which
was performed by two ants, one pulling at the free
end of the root, and the other gnawing at its fibres
where the strain was greatest, until at length it gave
way. Again the habit of throwing sick and apparently
dead ants into the water, the object of which
was in part, I imagine, to be rid of them, and partly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[ 46 ]</a></span>
perhaps with a view to effecting a possible cure, for
I have seen one ant carry another down the twig
which formed their path to the surface of the water,
and, after dipping it in for a minute, carry it laboriously
up again, and lay it in the sun to dry and
recover; thirdly, the stripping off the coats and
husks of seed and grain swelling and on the point
of sprouting, previous to eating it; and finally, the
actual eating of the contents of the seed.</p>

<p>Most of these operations are usually performed below
ground, and even in my captive nest it was but rarely
that I could get a glimpse of their subterranean life,
as they avoided the glass as much as possible, though
it was carefully covered with flannel and black paper;
and it was only by having the nest constantly before
me on my table, and thus becoming a witness of their
operations day and night during four months, that I
detected them in positions which permitted me to
watch these actions of theirs.</p>

<p>The ants were in the habit of coming out in numbers
of an evening to enjoy the warmth and light of
my lamp, and it was on one of these occasions that I
first observed them in the act of eating. I perceived
that in the midst of the black mass of ants gathered
together on the side of the glass jar one was holding
up a white roundish mass about as big as a large pin's
head. Having turned a stream of bright light passed
through a condenser on this group, and being permitted
by the ants to make free use of my pocket lens,
I was able to see the details with great precision. The
white mass appeared to be the floury portion of a grain
of millet, and I could see that two or three ants at a
time would scrape off minute particles with their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[ 47 ]</a></span>
toothed mandibles, and take them into their mouths, repeating
the operation many times, before giving place
to other ants, and often returning again. It certainly
appeared to be a <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> meal that they were making,
and not merely an act performed for the benefit of the
larv&aelig;, as when they detach crumbs from a piece of
bread and carry them below into the nest. However,
I must own that, though I subsequently dissected
ants taken in this act, which I suppose to be that of
eating, I was unable by the use of the iodine test to
detect starch grains in their stomachs.</p>

<p>Still it seems quite possible that this failure may
have been due to my not having allowed the ants
sufficient time to swallow their food, as I killed them
almost immediately after disturbing them at their
meal.</p>

<p>After having twice observed the ants eating as
above described, I made some experiments in feeding
them myself.</p>

<p>They immediately seized and set to work upon a
minute ball of flour which I cut out from the centre
of a grain of millet, taken from a heap in front of a
nest of <i>A. structor</i>, which had begun to sprout and
been deprived of its radicle and dried. A similar ball
taken from a sprouting grain of millet, but the growth
of which had not been arrested, was also partially
eaten; but the hard, dry flour taken from a grain of
the same in its natural state, not moistened, was at
once rejected and thrown on the rubbish heap. The
fat, oily seed leaves of the hemp, however, were eagerly
taken, though not softened by water, their peculiar
texture allowing the ants to scrape off particles, as in
the case of the ball of flour of the sprouted millet.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[ 48 ]</a></span>
Under ordinary circumstances the hard shell of the
hemp-seed, and the coats of most other small fruits,
grain, and seeds, would prevent the ants from getting
at the contents while dry, but in the earliest stage of
sprouting the shell parts of itself, allowing the radicle
to protrude, and then they find their opportunity. (See
Figs. A, A 2, <a href="#Plate_VI">Plate VI.</a>, p. 35.)</p>

<p>It has always been supposed that ants, from the
delicate nature of their mouth organs, were only able
to lap up liquids or to swallow very soft animal tissues,
and one of the great difficulties in the way of admitting
that they might collect seeds for food, lay in the
apparent impossibility of their eating such hard substances.
But it has generally been overlooked that
not only are all seeds soft when moistened with water
and ready to grow, but also that there are certain
kinds of seeds the contents of which are naturally
soft.</p>

<p>The most important organs in an ant's mouth are
shown in Fig. D 2, and D 3, in <a href="#Plate_I">Plate I.</a>, p. 21. D 3 represents
one of the horny, toothed mandibles, which
serve admirably for scraping off particles of flour from
the seeds. Within these are the parts shown at D 2,
where the outermost pieces are the maxill&aelig; and their
four-jointed palpi or feelers, and the innermost piece
the labium and its three-jointed palpi, between which
the end of the delicate membranous tongue appears.</p>

<p>I repeatedly placed leaves from the orange trees
covered with cocci and aphides from rose-bushes and
pine trees, all of which are eagerly sought by several
other kinds of ants, in the captive nest, but the ants
never looked twice at them, and this corresponds with
the fact that I have never seen either <i>structor</i> or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[ 49 ]</a></span>
<i>barbara</i> attending on or searching for aphides and the
like. These captives took part of a small quantity of
honey which I placed in the nest, but displayed no
eagerness about it, and soon neglected and allowed it
to be covered up with earth thrown out from the nest.</p>

<p>The ants work very frequently at night during
the dark,<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and this is the case in the wild as well
as in the captive nests. A friend, at my request
twice visited a nest of <i>structor</i> ants in the garden of an
hotel at Mentone, when it was quite dark (in March,
between seven and eight o'clock <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>) and no moon,
but the light of a candle showed that the workers,
both large and small, were busily engaged in carrying
into the nest seeds which had been purposely scattered
in their neighbourhood. I have myself seen <i>Pheidole
megacephala</i> similarly engaged at about nine <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> on
a warm night in April, when it was perfectly dark,
not even the stars showing; but in this case the ants
were collecting from the weeds in the garden. On the
same occasion I also observed long and active trains
of <i>Formica emarginata</i> [a rather small dusky ant, with
a yellow thorax], making for the orange-trees in search
of cocci and aphides, just as if it were broad day.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_32" id="Footnote_32"></a><a href="#FNanchor_32"><span class="label">[32]</span></a> This bears out the much-questioned assertion of Aristotle, though he
only claimed that ants work "by night when the moon is at the full."&mdash;Hist.
Anim., lib. ix. cap. xxvi.</p></div>

<p>Before leaving Mentone, on May 1, I turned out
this second captive nest, and found that the colony
appeared perfectly healthy, and did not seem to have
diminished materially in numbers. The queen ant
and the larv&aelig; seemed to be in just the same state as
when they were taken. The earth in the lower part
of the jar was honeycombed with galleries, granaries,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[ 50 ]</a></span>
and cells, constructed quite as in the wild nests, but
more crowded together. The granaries were in many
instances full of seeds, which, though very wet, [the
surrounding soil being extremely moist on account of
there being no drainage to carry off the water which
I was obliged to sprinkle from time to time over the
surface of the nest], still showed no trace of germination
that I could detect. The ants were therefore able to
exercise the same influence over these seeds, under
the strange conditions of their captive state, that
they do in their natural homes.</p>

<p>The foregoing remarks, as has been stated above,
refer for the most part to only one of the three
kinds of harvesting ants which I have observed on
the Riviera&mdash;that is to say, to <i>Atta barbara</i>, the jet-black
ant.</p>

<p>As far as the manner of collecting and storing the
seed is concerned, all that has been said of <i>Atta
barbara</i> applies with equal truth to <i>A. structor</i>.</p>

<p><i>A. structor</i> is, however, less frequently seen above
ground from December to March than <i>barbara</i>, and
is more frequently found in or near the streets and
gardens of a town.</p>

<p>The fourth species, on the other hand, the little
<i>Pheidole megacephala</i>, differs in several particulars. This
ant appears to shun the daylight, and to be most active
at night, when, in the warm weather at the end of
April, it may frequently be seen carrying large quantities
of seeds into its nest. I have rarely observed
it at work in the daylight, so that my knowledge of
its habits is but small. Nor have I succeeded in discovering
its subterranean granaries, though I have
opened several nests. Still, I believe that it is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[ 51 ]</a></span>
true harvesting ant, and not merely a casual collector of
seeds. Of the habits of <i>Pheidole pallidula</i>, a very closely
allied and similar species, but one less frequently met
with, I cannot speak with certainty, though it is
quite possible that it also may be a true harvester, in
which case it would add a fifth species to this class.</p>

<p>Both <i>Pheidole megacephala</i> and <i>Ph. pallidula</i> appear
to remain inactive, or nearly so, during the months
from November to April, and it is probable that they
are only to be seen in full activity during the summer
when I am not there to watch them.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that any naturalist who
will take the pains to note the habits of ants on the
shores of the Mediterranean through June, July,
August, and September, might collect a most interesting
series of observations on harvesting and other
species, and add to, and perhaps modify, those
which my limited opportunities have enabled me to
make.</p>

<p>There are three other ants<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>&mdash;namely, <i>Formica emarginata</i>,
<i>F. fusca</i>, and <i>Myrmica c&aelig;spitum</i>, which may also
occasionally be found carrying a few seeds, but this is
the rare exception, as far as my experience goes,
these species living on honey dew, sweet secretions,
and animal matter, like the great majority of ants all
over the world. I have never found seeds in the
nests of any ants except those of <i>Atta barbara</i> and
<i>A. structor</i>, though I have carefully searched for them
in most of the nests of the sixteen species of ants
whose habits I have watched.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_33" id="Footnote_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_33"><span class="label">[33]</span></a> For some details of the habits of the sixteen species of ants observed on
the Riviera, see <a href="#Appendix_A1">Appendix A</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[ 52 ]</a></span></p></div>

<p>There is every probability that these harvesting
ants will be found all round the shores of the Mediterranean,
but the only points at which I have positively
heard of the existence of the habit besides Mentone,
Cannes, and Marseilles, are Capri<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> and Algiers.
I am indebted to Miss Forster for having, during a
short visit to Algiers, devoted some time to watching
the habits of the ants in a garden at that place.
These observations were made in April last (1872),
when the three following species were watched:&mdash;</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_34" id="Footnote_34"></a><a href="#FNanchor_34"><span class="label">[34]</span></a> Where a harvester, probably <i>Atta barbara</i>, has been observed by Mr.
Buchanan White. See <a href="#Appendix_C1">Appendix C</a>.</p></div>

<p>(1) <i>Formica (Cataglyphis) viatica</i>, a large, long-legged,
blackish ant, with orange-red and semi-transparent
thorax, which never carried seeds, but lived on animal
food, especially flies. (2) <i>Formica (Tapinoma) nigerrima</i>,<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
a rather small dusky ant, which brought in some seeds
to its nest, but principally "animal food, flies, small
worms," &amp;c., and which did not carry the hemp and
canary seed strewed in their path, though on one occasion
when Miss Forster scattered some split hemp seed,
they eagerly fastened upon the contents, and ate some
on the spot, while they transported the greater part to
their nest, and (3) <i>Atta barbara</i>, which, as on the
Riviera, was a true and most active harvester, and
eagerly seized upon the hemp and canary seed when
these were placed in its way.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_35" id="Footnote_35"></a><a href="#FNanchor_35"><span class="label">[35]</span></a> Mr. Smith thinks that this ant is either <i>F. nigerrima</i>, of Nylander, or a
new species, but it was not possible for him to pronounce with absolute
certainty as he had only two specimens of workers from which to judge.</p></div>


<p><i>Recapitulation and Concluding Remarks.</i></p>

<p>There are some points of interest suggesting openings
for future observation, to which I will now allude,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[ 53 ]</a></span>
making at the same time a partial recapitulation of
what has gone before.</p>

<p>We have learned in the first place that the ancients
had facts on their side when they said that the ant is
one of the very few creatures which lays up supplies
of food sufficient to last for months, or even perhaps,
as Bochart says, for a whole year; and though we
cannot quite accept the statement that "there is no
animal except men, mice, and ants, that stores its
food,"<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> they were right in saying that the habit is a
most singular and interesting one. It is probable,
however, that the old writers may have fallen into
the error of supposing that all ants were harvesters,
though the truth appears to be, that even in hot
climates, it is only a very small number of species
that are so. The fact that certain ants in Southern
Europe do store large quantities of sound seed in
damp soil, and check their tendency to germinate,
may be thought to favour the possibility of the existence
of those deeply hidden supplies of seed which,
though they have never been detected, are popularly
supposed to explain the sudden appearance of the
crops of weeds on soil newly brought out from great
depths.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_36" id="Footnote_36"></a><a href="#FNanchor_36"><span class="label">[36]</span></a> Sophian, quoted by Bochart in his Hierozo&iuml;con, ii. cap. xxi, p. 497.</p></div>

<p>The argument may be stated thus: seeds remain
for months undecayed, and still capable of germination,
at depths varying from one to twenty inches below
the surface of the soil in certain ants' nests, why
should they not lie hidden for indefinite periods in
ordinary soil?</p>

<p>To answer this positively, experiments should be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[ 54 ]</a></span>
made<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> in order that we might learn whether these
seeds can retain their vitality without sprouting in
moist soil; but the general belief is that under these
conditions they will do one of two things, they will
either grow or rot. Be this as it may, one of the
most curious points that we have learned about these
ants, is that they know how to preserve seeds intact,
even when within from one to three inches of the
surface of the ground, that is to say, at the actual
depth at which a gardener most frequently sows his
seeds, though if these very seeds are taken out of the
granary and sowed by hand, they will germinate in
the ordinary way. It is possible that this may be in
part due to the compact nature of the floors and
ceilings of the granaries, these excluding air in some
measure, though as moisture freely passes through
them, and there are always two or three open galleries
leading into the granaries, and which communicate
directly with the open air, I can scarcely accept this
explanation as complete.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_37" id="Footnote_37"></a><a href="#FNanchor_37"><span class="label">[37]</span></a> In order to try the experiment fairly, seeds taken from ants' nests, or
seeds of the same species as those which are habitually found in ants' nests,
should be placed at different depths in the earth and examined after the
lapse of six or eight months.
</p>

<p>Why it is that certain seeds resist the influences which destroy the vitality
of other seeds of closely allied species is another and a very curious but
complicated problem, the explanation of which may perhaps lie in the
different chemical properties of the seeds in question, in the more or less
permeable character of their seed-coats, or their general texture.</p></div>

<p>The seeds do occasionally sprout in the nest, though
it is extremely rare to find instances of this, and then
the ants nip off the little root, and carry each seed
out into the air and sun, exactly as the old writers
have described, and when the growth has been checked
and the seed malted by exposure, they fetch them in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[ 55 ]</a></span>
again. It is in this condition that the ants like best
to eat them, as I have proved by experiments among
my captives.</p>

<p>As the ants often travel some distance from their
nest in search of food, they may certainly be said to
be, in a limited sense, agents in the dispersal of seeds,
for they not unfrequently drop seeds by the way,
which they fail to find again, and also among the
refuse matter which forms the kitchen midden in
front of their entrances, a few sound seeds are often
present, and these in many instances grow up and
form a little colony of stranger plants. This presence
of seedlings foreign to the wild ground in which the
nest is usually placed, is quite a feature where there
are old established colonies of <i>Atta barbara</i>, as is shown
at Fig. A in <a href="#Plate_I">Plate I.</a>, p. 21, where young plants of
fumitory, chickweed, cranesbill, <i>Arabis Thaliana</i>, &amp;c.,
may be seen on or near the rubbish heap.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to make a list of all these
ant-imported plants, and I think it quite likely that,
if a sufficiently large number of nests were visited,
some seedlings of cultivated species might be found
amongst them, for we have seen that garden plants
are frequently put under contribution.</p>

<p>One can imagine cases in which the ants during the
lapse of long periods of time might pass the seeds of
plants from colony to colony, until after a journey of
many stages, the descendants of the ant-borne seedlings
might find themselves transported to places far removed
from the original home of their immediate ancestors. It
is a true cause, but at the same time it may be one which
has, like many true causes, exceedingly small effects.
One can scarcely look at the teeming population of an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[ 56 ]</a></span>
ant's nest, without asking whether there are any
checks to their increase, and if so, what these checks are.
I know very little of what foreign enemies they may
have, though I have occasionally seen them captured
by lizards, <i>Cicindela</i> beetles, and spiders,<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and it is
well known that the females are eagerly sought for
by birds at the season when they are above ground,
and about to found new colonies; but I believe that
ants are the ants' worst enemies, for fearful slaughter
and mutilation often result from the encounter of
armies of the same race, but belonging to different
nests.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_38" id="Footnote_38"></a><a href="#FNanchor_38"><span class="label">[38]</span></a> I have seen the remains of ants at the bottom of the tube of trap-door
spider nests, and watched a hunting spider, <i>Lycosa</i>, capture a large black
ant (<i>Formica pubescens</i>), by entangling it in threads, which it deftly spun
about its limbs, while running rapidly round the struggling victim in a
circle, and dodging out of the way of the ant's mandibles. In England
one may frequently see ants caught in the spiders' webs among the rose-bushes,
and Mr. Blackwall says, in his Spiders of Great Britain and Ireland,
that <i>Theridion riparium</i> lives principally on ants.</p></div>

<p>Harvesting ants have nothing to do, as far as
I have been able to discover, with aphides, cocci,
and the like, nor do they seek for any of those
sweet secretions which are the staple food of the
generality of ants; they live, however, on very
friendly terms with certain yellowish-white and
satiny-coated "silver-fish" (<i>Lepisma</i>), which are found
in the passages and chambers of the nests; but
what their relations are to these creatures and to
certain beetles which have been found in the nests of
<i>Atta barbara</i> in Spain and Syria is unknown. It is
possible that by carefully watching captive ants in
company with these creatures under very favourable
conditions, something further might be learned on
this head. My captive ants constructed all their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[ 57 ]</a></span>
chambers, granaries, and almost all their galleries
away from the glass, and in the interior of the earth,
though I tried to tempt them to work in parts more
accessible to sight by swathing the jar in flannel.</p>

<p>There is much to be learned, I do not doubt, about
the friends and enemies of harvesting ants; and another
great desideratum is further information as to
the parts of the world in which they are found and
what causes may be assigned for the limitation of the
habit.</p>

<p>What is the geographical distribution of the harvesting
species, and what the geographical distribution
of the habit? For instance, to quote Mr. F. Smith,<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
<i>Atta structor</i>, though not "found in England, is scattered
over a great part of Europe, having occurred in
France, Italy, Germany, Austria, Dalmatia, and Switzerland;
it has also been found in Algeria" and Syria;
and <i>A. barbara</i> is almost as widely spread. May we then
conclude that these species are harvesters wherever they
are found, and that they store seed in Germany and
Switzerland as freely as they do on the shores of the
Mediterranean? If this be really so, then Huber, whose
attention was specially directed to this point, and a host
of laborious and scrupulous observers of the Continent,
have had the very fact under their eyes, though they
have been at considerable pains expressly to deny it.
I cannot think that this is likely, but it is a matter
which could easily be settled by those who travel or
reside in Germany, Northern France, or Switzerland.</p>

Journ. Linnean Soc., London, vol. vi. p. 35.</p></div>

<p>It seems to me more probable, however, that they
do store in the south, but not in the north; for all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[ 58 ]</a></span>
difficulties which attend the preservation of the seed
in the granaries in the south would be greatly increased
in the wet climates of Northern Europe, and
there, moreover, the greater cold would render the
ants torpid almost throughout the winter, when food
would not be required. But the question is plainly
an open one. We may also ask why it is that only
a very few out of the many species of ants which
inhabit the shores of the Mediterranean should
possess this habit of collecting seeds, and differ so
widely in their manner of living, from their neighbours?</p>

<p>If we wish to put ourselves in the way to answer
these queries, the first thing we should do would be
to examine and compare the structure of the digestive
organs and parts of the mouth in harvesters and non-harvesters,
with a view to seeing whether there may
not be some capital difference here.</p>

<p>These observations demand some skill in dissection
and preparation, and in regretting that it has not
been in my power to make them, I can only hope
that some one more skilled than I am may undertake
the subject.</p>

<p>It seems probable, that in warmer latitudes
there are many conditions which favour the rapid
increase of ants, so that a given tract of country
in Southern Europe, for example, must have on an
average more colonies to support than a similar
tract in the north, and that to meet this increase of
population, it has therefore become necessary for these
creatures to seek their subsistence from as many and
as dissimilar sources as possible. The fierce conflicts
over booty both between rival nests of the same and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[ 59 ]</a></span>
of distinct species, tend to show that, even as things
are, they frequently have to fight for their food.</p>

<p>Hitherto, as far as I have been able to learn, only
nineteen true harvesting ants have been detected in
the whole world, limiting this term to those species
which make the collection of seeds the principal occupation
of their outdoor lives, and are evidently in the
main dependent upon this kind of food for subsistence.</p>

<p>Now if we compare these nineteen species of ants<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
together a very curious fact forces itself upon our
notice&mdash;namely, that all of them are closely related,
so much so that not only do all belong to the same
division of ants (the tribe <i>Myrmicine&aelig;</i>), but that with
one exception (<i>Pseudomyrma</i>) all would have been
placed by the great Fabricius in one genus, <i>Atta</i>, and
the one exception is not far removed from it.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_40" id="Footnote_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_40"><span class="label">[40]</span></a> These are <i>Myrmica (Atta) barbata</i>, from Texas and Mexico; <i>&#338;codoma
(Atta) cephalotes</i>, from Brazil and Mexico; <i>&#338;codoma (Atta) providens</i>, from
India; <i>&#338;codoma (Atta) diffusa</i>, from India; <i>Atta rufa</i>, from India; <i>Pheidole
(Atta) megacephala</i>, from South France; <i>Atta barbara</i>, from South France,
Capri, and Algiers; <i>Atta structor</i>, from South France; and <i>Pseudomyrma
rufo nigra</i>, from India.</p></div>

<p>We must not forget, however, that, as has been
stated, there are other ants which do occasionally
collect seeds, and thus appear to show traces of this
remarkable instinct; but as far as I have yet seen, it
is always possible to distinguish them readily from true
harvesters. Still I think it very likely that in hot
climates the division between harvesters and non-harvesters
may be bridged over by a complete chain
of intermediates. Here two more questions suggest
themselves for more complete future solution. (1)
Do true harvesters which store seed in granaries ever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[ 60 ]</a></span>
attend upon aphides and seek for sweet secretions?
(2) Do occasional harvesters ever form granaries?</p>

<p>In any case the name of "the provident one"
is only, I suspect, fully deserved by a limited number
of ants, and &AElig;sop, in his well-known fable, might
as properly have made the dialogue which ends in
the recommendation to "dance in winter as he piped
in summer," take place between two ants as between
an ant and a grasshopper, as far at least as their
respective foresight is concerned.</p>

<p>Why it is that one ant should require stores of
food in the winter of which other ants have no need,
is one of the many problems which only patient
watching and careful comparison and experiment
can help us to solve.</p>

<p>There are not wanting those among the many
winter visitors of the south who have time in abundance
or superabundance at their disposal, and might
help to clear up these and many other mysteries,
and to them I would strongly recommend the study
of the habits of plants and animals as a pastime, if
nothing more.</p>

<p>The way is open: it is not difficult to follow, and
it leads to very pleasant places.</p>

<p>The following are the species of ants which I have observed
on the Riviera, and principally at Mentone; the actual locality
where my notes were taken being given in every case.</p>


<p class="tdc"><i>Family Formicid&aelig;.</i><a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_41" id="Footnote_41"></a><a href="#FNanchor_41"><span class="label">[41]</span></a> Ants have been divided into three tribes, the two first of which,
<i>Formicine&aelig;</i> and <i>Ponerine&aelig;</i>, are distinguished by the latter having a contraction
in the abdomen not found in the former, and both are separated from
the third tribe, <i>Myrmicine&aelig;</i> by having but a single scale on the petiole,
while in <i>Myrmicine&aelig;</i> there are always two nodes or protuberances on the
petiole. It is important to remember the difference between the first and
the last named tribes, as we shall find that all the true harvesters belong
to <i>Myrmicine&aelig;</i>. I have not seen any of the representatives of the second
tribe in the south.</p></div>

<p><i>Tribe Formicine&aelig;.</i>&mdash;Petiole (or stalk which unites the
thorax and the abdomen) of one joint, and furnished with a
single vertical scale, abdomen not contracted.</p>

<p>(1) <i>Formica fusca</i>, Linn.&mdash;A rather large ant (3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> to 4<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>
lines long), of a blackish ash colour, with a satiny sheen on
the upper half of the abdomen. Smells of formic acid when
crushed. Lives upon sweet secretions and animal matter,
and occasionally carries a very few seeds into its nest, which
is made in the ground. (Mentone.)</p>

<p>(2) <i>F. emarginata</i>, Latr.&mdash;Of medium size (2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> lines),
brownish, with yellow thorax. Has a strong smell of honey
when crushed. Lives principally upon sweet secretions, but
occasionally carries a very few seeds also. Nest in the ground.
(Mentone.)</p>

<p>(3) <i>F. (Camponotus) cruentata</i>, Lat.&mdash;Large (5 to 6 lines),
dusky brown, with orange red on legs and abdomen. Strong
smell of formic acid. Lives on sweet secretions and animal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[ 62 ]</a></span>
matter, and has never been seen by me carrying seeds. Nest
in the ground. (Mentone and Cannes.)</p>

<p>(4) <i>F. (Camponotus) marginata</i>, Latr.&mdash;Large (4 to 5<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>
lines), black. Has no perceptible smell even when crushed.
Lives principally on sweet secretions, and does not bring in
seeds to its nest, which is made in the ground. I have seen
this ant at Cannes ascending the cork oaks in search of certain
cocci which resemble black and shining berries rather larger
than a pea, and which exude sweet secretions. (Mentone
and Cannes.)</p>

<p>(5) <i>Formica cursor</i>, Fonscol.&mdash;A rather large but slender
ant (3 to 4 lines long), nearly black, with a faint bronzy hue,
legs very long. Smell not noted. Runs very swiftly, and is
hard to catch; feeds on sweet secretions, and does not carry
seeds. Nest in ground. (Cannes.)</p>

<p>(6) <i>F.</i> (species undetermined).&mdash;A large ant (5 to 6<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> lines),
black brown with yellow thorax and legs. In shape resembles
<i>F. marginata</i>. Strong smell of formic acid. Habits not
observed. Nest found under a stone in a pine wood. (Cannes.)</p>

<p>(7) <i>F.</i> (species undetermined).&mdash;A rather large ant (3 to
4<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> lines), resembling <i>F. fusca</i>, but having the thorax yellow.
Strong smell of formic acid. Feeds on sweet secretions, and
does not carry seeds. Nest in ground. (Cannes.)</p>

<p>(8) <i>Formica (Tapinoma) erratica</i>, Latr.&mdash;Rather small
(2 lines), nearly black. Has a strong and most disagreeable
smell, something like rancid oil, which is emitted if the nest
is disturbed or the insect crushed. Lives upon sweet secretions
and animal matter, but rarely if ever carries seeds, and
pays no attention to them if placed in its path. It nests in
the ground, and forms superficial covered ways, roofed in with
a thin crust of earth and vegetable fibres cemented together.
(Mentone, Cannes.)</p>

<p><i>Tribe Myrmicine&aelig;</i>. Petiole two jointed, furnished with
two nodes (protuberances).</p>

<p>(9) <i>Crematogaster (Myrmica) scutellaris</i>, Oliv.&mdash;Of
medium size (3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> to 4 lines), nearly black, with yellowish red
head. Disagreeable smell like rancid oil when crushed.
Erects the abdomen when excited, and runs about with it
turned up at right angles to the body. Lives on sweet secretions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[ 63 ]</a></span>
and does not carry seeds. When dissecting the abdomen
of this ant, I noticed that in freshly killed specimens a
drop of poison appears at the extremity of the sting, which
if brushed away will form again several times in succession.
Nest in the bark and wood of sick or decayed trees. (Mentone
and Cannes.)</p>

<p>(10) <i>C. sordidulus</i>, Mayr.&mdash;Very small (1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> to 2 lines),
resembles <i>C. scutellaris</i>, but is uniformly black brown. No
perceptible smell. Lives on sweet secretions, and may frequently
be seen inside flowers. Nest in earth. Behaves like
<i>C. scutellaris</i> when excited. (Mentone and Cannes.)</p>

<p>(11) <i>Myrmica c&aelig;spitum</i>, Latr.&mdash;Small (2 lines), brown.
Faint smell like peat smoke. Feeds on animal food and sweet
secretions, and may occasionally be seen collecting and carrying
in seeds. Nest in the ground. (Mentone and Cannes.)</p>

<p>(12) <i>Pheidole (Atta</i> or <i>Myrmica) megacephala</i>.&mdash;Very small
(1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> to 2 lines), yellow, the larger workers having enormous
heads. Smell very peculiar, and a trifle like aniseed when
crushed. Appears to be a true harvester, and not to seek for
sweet secretions. Nest in ground. (Mentone and Cannes.)</p>

<p>(13) <i>Ph. (Atta</i> or <i>Myrmica) pallidula</i>.&mdash;Very small (1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>
lines), pale yellow, closely resembles <i>Ph. megacephala</i>, but is
paler and more transparent, and the larger workers have less
disproportionate heads. Smell not noted. Habits not fully
observed. Nest in ground. (Mentone.)</p>

<p>(14) <i>Atta (Aphenogaster</i> or <i>Myrmica) structor</i>.&mdash;Rather
large (2 to 4 lines), of a claret brown. No smell when crushed.
A true harvester, and does not appear to seek for sweet
secretions, though it will occasionally take animal food. Nest
in ground or under stones. (Mentone and Cannes.)</p>

<p>(15) <i>Atta (Aph.</i> or <i>Myrmica) barbara</i>.&mdash;Rather large
(2 to 4 lines), jet black. No smell when crushed. Habits of
<i>structor</i>. Nest in earth, and more frequently in uncultivated
ground. I have twice seen a few ants coloured like <i>structor</i>
in colonies of <i>barbara</i>. (Mentone, Cannes, and Marseilles.)</p>

<p>(16) <i>Atta (Aph.</i> or <i>Myrmica) barbara</i> var.&mdash;A large ant (3
to 6 lines). The larger workers black, with red or mahogany-coloured
heads, the smaller most frequently black, and like
those of <i>Atta barbara</i>, of which this is probably only a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[ 64 ]</a></span>
variety. It differs however in its smell, which, when the
body is crushed, resembles that of <i>Pheidole megacephala</i>,
and is something like aniseed. Habits of <i>structor</i> and
<i>barbara</i>. Nest in earth. On one occasion I opened a large
nest at Cannes, where the colony was composed in about equal
parts of ants which in colour and appearance might be said
to represent the three forms, <i>structor</i>, <i>barbara</i>, and the red-headed
variety of the latter. There were also a few ants
with pale yellowish brown heads. (Mentone and Cannes.)</p>

<p>The following Indian species are described by the late Dr.
Jerdon as harvesters, in the Madras Journal Lit. and Sc.
1851:&mdash;</p>

<p>(p. 45). <i>Atta rufa.</i>&mdash;"Its favourite food is dead insects
and other matter, but it also carries off seeds like the <i>&#338;codoma</i>,
chaff," &amp;c. &amp;c. (p. 46). <i>&#338;codoma providens.</i>&mdash;"Their
common food I suspect to be animal matter, dead insects,
&amp;c. &amp;c., which at all events they take readily, but they also
carry off large quantities of seeds of various kinds, especially
light grass seeds, and more especially garden seeds, as every
gardener knows to his cost. They will take off cabbage,
celery, radish, carrot, and tomato seeds, and in some gardens,
unless the pots in which they are sown be suspended or
otherwise protected, the whole of the seeds sown will be removed
in one night. I have also had many packets of seeds
(especially lettuce) in my room completely emptied before I
was aware that the ants had discovered them. I do not
know, however, if they eat them or feed their larv&aelig; on them,
though for what other purpose they carry them off I cannot
divine. I have often observed them bring the seeds outside
their holes, as recorded by Colonel Sykes, and this I think
generally at the close of the rainy season; but in some cases
I had reason to believe that it was merely the husks, of
which I have seen quite heaps, and that the ants did not take
them back to their nests. If any of the forementioned seeds
be sown out at once in a bed, most likely in the morning the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[ 65 ]</a></span>
surface of the whole spot will be found covered over with little
ridges, the works of these creatures, and the few seeds that
perhaps remain, dug all round, and being carried off sometimes
above ground, at other times under ground. Their galleries
and subterranean passages are often very extensive, and it is
no easy matter to dig down to their nest to see what becomes
of the seeds." <i>&#338;codoma diffusa</i> has the same habits as
<i>&#338;. providens</i>.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Col. Sykes, <i>Descriptions of New Indian Ants</i> in
<i>Trans. Ent. Soc. Lond.</i>, i. 103 (1836).</p>

<p><i>Atta providens</i>, Sykes. "In illustration of the habits of
this species of ant, I shall give the following extract from my
diary:&mdash;'Poona, June 19, 1829. In my morning walk I
observed more than a score of little heaps of grass-seeds
(<i>Panicum</i>) in several places on uncultivated land near the
parade-ground; each heap contained about a handful. On
examination, I found they were raised by the above species
of ant, hundreds of which were employed in bringing up
the seeds to the surface from a store below; the grain had
probably got wet at the setting in of the monsoon, and the
ants had taken advantage of the first sunny day to bring it
up to dry. The store must have been laid up from the time
of the ripening of the grass-seeds in January and February.
As I was aware this fact militated against the observations of
entomologists in Europe, I was careful not to deceive myself
by confounding the seeds of a <i>Panicum</i> with the pup&aelig; of the
insect. Each ant was charged with a single seed, but as it
was too weighty for many of them, and as the strongest had
some difficulty in scaling the perpendicular sides of the cylindrical
hole leading to the nest below, many were the falls of
the weaker ants with their burdens from near the summit to
the bottom. I observed they never relaxed their hold, and
with a perseverance affording a useful lesson to humanity,
steadily recommenced the ascent after each successive tumble,
nor halted in their labour until they had crowned the
summit, and lodged their burden on the common heap.'"</p>

<p>(p. 104). "On the 13th of October of the same year,
after the closing thunderstorms of the monsoon, I found
this species in various places similarly employed as they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[ 66 ]</a></span>
had been in June preceding; one heap contained a double
handful of grass-seeds. It is probable that the <i>Atta providens</i>
is a field species of ant, as I have not observed it
in the houses."</p>

<hr class="tb" />


<p class="caption3nb" id="Appendix_C1">C.</p>

<p>After the appearance of a brief notice of a communication
which I sent in the winter of 1871-72 to the London Entomological
Society, announcing the fact that certain ants harvest
seeds in a systematic way at Mentone, two papers were published,
in which confirmatory evidence of the existence of the
habit in other parts of the world was set forth&mdash;one by Mr.
Buchanan White, and the other by the late Mr. Horne.</p>

<p>Mr. Horne's account of his observations was published in
<i>Hardwicke's Science Gossip</i>, No. 89, p. 109 (for May 1, 1872),
and runs as follows:<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p>"My notes carry me to the far East, where I have often
watched this most interesting class of insects, and briefly
recorded my observations&mdash;unfortunately cut short by illness,
and the necessity of return to Europe, which must be my
apology for their want of completeness.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_42" id="Footnote_42"></a><a href="#FNanchor_42"><span class="label">[42]</span></a> I omit the preliminary portion, in which my observations are erroneously
stated to have been made at Nismes and Capri.</p></div>

<p>"But before transcribing, I would remind my general reader
that all ants may be seen carrying off food to their nests for
present consumption, and that this food consists of a great
variety of substances. This is disposed of inside the said nest,
being often masticated, and the juice extracted by the workers,
and then given in an inspissated form from their mouths to
the young grubs, which are in general tended by their nurses
with the greatest care. It is indeed very curious to watch
this feeding process; but to proceed.</p>

<p>"Under date Nov. 7th, 1866, I find in my natural history
note-book as follows:&mdash;Mainpuri. This morning as I was
walking across the 'Oosur,' or waste plain, where it was very
sandy, being cut into small ravines, and clothed only here and
there with fine grass disposed in clumps, thus forming little
hillocks of sand blown by the wind, and arrested in its course
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[ 67 ]</a></span>
by the grass, I came across a long line of ants, travelling four
deep, some coming empty, and others laden each with one
grass-seed, on their way home.</p>

<p>"I followed up the procession to the nest, which was subterranean,
and at the mouth of which on the level plain there
was no trace of elevation caused by the soil brought up from
below, owing to the habit of these ants of taking each grain
of sand to some distance along their road, and depositing it
on one side or the other.</p>

<p>"There may have been five or six entrances to the nest, in
and out of which a prodigious number of ants were passing,
the species of which has been described by Dr. Jerdon. They
were of a medium size, shortish bodies, and of a reddish-brown
colour&mdash;<i>Pseudomyrma rufo-nigra</i>, Jerdon. Around the
mouth of the nest, forming a circle of perhaps eighteen inches
in diameter, was a space beaten flat, and kept clear by these
said ants, from which radiated in every direction thirteen roads,
each about four inches in width for about thirty to forty yards,
when they branched off and became narrower, being ultimately
lost amongst the grass roots. These paths were fairly straight;
they did not cut through elevations, but went round them.</p>

<p>"From a careful examination it appeared that they had
been cleared of all obstacles, such as small stones, twigs, &amp;c.,
but that their smoothness resulted only from the tread of
countless feet.</p>

<p>"The bearers of burdens took the seeds <i>into</i> the nest, which
I did not dig up, and certainly stored them there, after having
prepared them, probably by the removal of a portion of the
outer husk. Of these husks there were large collections near
the entrances to the nest, all carefully set aside by the ants.</p>

<p>"In times of famine, I am told, not only are the nests rifled
of their grass-seed stores, but these heaps of apparent husks
are collected and ground with other grain to eke out a
subsistence.</p>

<p>"This kind of grain has a name, 'Jurroon,' derived from
'Jharna,' to sweep, literally sweepings. I much regret that
I have not preserved specimens of this 'Jurroon,' for it is
very unlikely that the ants after taking it to their granary,
should again throw it out, and yet, if grainless, what benefit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[ 68 ]</a></span>
could there be in eating it? The season of the year when I
observed them (November) is the beginning of the cold
weather, and no rain would probably fall (excepting a little at
Christmas) till next May or June. Later on seed would be
rare; and how the nest fares at a time when floods of water
often pass over the plain I cannot conceive.</p>

<p>"It is clear that some escape, and we know with what prodigious
rapidity these colonies increase. But these jottings
have been recorded merely to show how this species of ant
store grain against a time of scarcity, and fully bear out the
statement in the text with which I commenced this paper."</p>

<p>The following are Dr. Buchanan White's notes, alluded to
above, published in the <i>Transactions of the Entomological
Society</i> (London, 1872) part i., Proceedings, p. v.:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Capri, June 3, 1866. In the afternoon to the Punta
Tragara, where a colony of ants afforded us much amusement.
These little insects had a regular road, made by cutting away
the grass and other plants in their way. This road was about
one inch and a half wide, and several yards long, and led to
a clump of plants in seed. Along this road a long train of
ants were perpetually travelling to the nest (or <i>formicarium</i>),
bearing with them pods of leguminous plants, seeds of grass
and of Composites (<i>Chrysanth. segetum</i>), &amp;c.</p>

<p>"The perseverance with which a single ant would tug and
draw a pod four times his own length was very interesting;
sometimes three or four ants would unite in carrying one
burden. Near the formicarium was a great mass of d&eacute;bris,
consisting of empty pods, twigs, emptied snail shells, &amp;c., cast
out by the ants. The seeds appeared to be stored inside the
nest, as in one that I opened the other day I found a large
collection. The species was a black ant; the formicarium
was underground."</p>

<p class="caption4nb"><i>On Collecting and Examining Ants.</i></p>

<p>There are very few branches of natural history which might
be more easily followed by a traveller, or one who fears to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[ 69 ]</a></span>
encumber himself with bulky collections difficult to transport
from place to place, than the study of ants. The whole
European ant fauna might be adequately represented by
specimens preserved in spirit of wine and packed in the
compass of a hat-box.</p>

<p>In taking specimens of ants it is important never to put
the representatives of more than one nest in each bottle, but
then in most cases a sufficient number may be placed in a
single bottle of the size used for containing the smaller
hom&#339;opathic globules. If possible the winged male and
female ants, as well as the wingless workers, should be secured.</p>

<p>The ants die very quickly in pure spirit of wine, and they
can afterwards, even after the lapse of months or more, be
pinned out in the cabinet after having been washed in warm
water. In examining the mouth organs of an ant in order to
determine by the aid of books to what genus it belongs, it is
best to relax the parts by first washing away the spirit of
wine, and then leaving the specimen for a day or more in a
stopper bottle partly filled with finely chopped laurel leaves.
It is probable that a drop or two of prussic acid on a bit of
sponge might act as effectually in rendering the tissues pliable.</p>

<p>A compound microscope is necessary for the final examination
of the joints of the labial and maxillary palpi (see Fig.
D 2, <a href="#Plate_I">Plate I.</a>, p. 21); but the neuration of the wing (D 1,
<a href="#Plate_I">Plate I.</a>), another very important character, is easily detected
with a good pocket-lens.</p>

<p>It is now one hundred and sixteen years since
Patrick Browne gave an illustration in his <i>Civil and
Natural History of Jamaica</i><a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> of the nest of a trap-door
spider, the first record of the kind with which I am
acquainted. Seven years later the careful observations
of the Abb&eacute; Sauvages appeared,<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> in which he
gave a very good description of the nests of the
"araign&eacute;e ma&ccedil;onne" (<i>Nemesia c&aelig;mentaria</i>), which he
discovered near Montpellier, likening them to little
rabbit burrows lined with silk and closed by a tightly-fitting
moveable door. In 1778 and 1794 Rossi<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
published an interesting account of the nest and
habits of a trap-door spider which he had observed in
Corsica and near Pisa; and from that time up to the
present day the curious dwellings of these creatures,
many species of which have been discovered in warm
climates, have continued to attract the attention of
naturalists.</p>

<p>Very little, however, has been added to our knowledge
of the life-history of these remarkable architects
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[ 74 ]</a></span>
for several years past, and, indeed, I think it
may be safely asserted that the study of the habits
and interdependence of the members of the animate
world has not, during the last fifty years, made anything
like a corresponding progress to that which
may be seen in classification and description. The
microscope has led many who, a century ago,
would have found their chief delight in observing
those points in the habits and external characters of
living creatures which the naked eye could readily
seize upon, to look much closer, to anatomize and
describe in detail every organism, great and small,
and to examine every tissue and cell.</p>

<p>It is, however, to the materials now being amassed
by these modern "cabinet naturalists" that recourse
must be had if we wish to form a true comprehension
of the functions and habits of living things. They
must tell us, for example, what instruments, tactile
and visual, an animal possesses if we wish to understand
how it constructs a particular fabric, so that the
"field naturalist" will have to apply to his brother
of the "cabinet" before he can turn his observations
to good account.</p>

<p>Still, the fact remains that the habits of plants and
animals afford many openings for careful investigation,
and such as are especially within the reach of
those lovers of nature who have ample time at their
disposal, and the opportunity to spend it in a warm
climate where life abounds, and is never wholly
checked even in the depth of winter. It seems
strange to think that collectors so frequently take
creatures out of wonderfully constructed nests and yet
never observe, or at any rate never describe, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[ 75 ]</a></span>
structure of these fabrics. Thus, for example, the
dwellings of only eight out of the thirty-six species
of trap-door spider stated by Prof. Ausserer<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> to belong
to the Mediterranean region are known in books,
those of the remaining twenty-eight being, as far as
I have been able to learn, yet to be discovered. This
is the more strange as from the nocturnal habits of
these creatures it is almost always necessary to dig
them out of their nests; indeed it is more than probable
that if all the dwellings which have been destroyed
had been described, the following pages would
never have appeared.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to pass briefly in review what
has been written on the subject of trap-door spiders,
it will be well to take one glance at the relation which
these spiders bear to their fellows. The great order
of spiders (<i>Arane&aelig;</i>) has recently<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> been divided into
seven sub-orders, the fourth of which, <i>Territelari&aelig;</i>,
includes all the trap-door spiders, and some others
which do not construct trap-doors. This sub-order
corresponds with that which was formerly called
<i>Mygalid&aelig;</i>, but this name, as well as that of <i>Mygale</i>,
originally given to all trap-door spiders, has been
abandoned because this latter name had previously
been applied to a genus of Mammals, and it was
feared that confusion might arise.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_47" id="Footnote_47"></a><a href="#FNanchor_47"><span class="label">[47]</span></a> Thorell, On European Spiders, in Nova Acta Reg. Soc. Scient. Upsaliensis,
ser. iii. vol. vii. fasc. 1 and 2 (1869-70).</p></div>

<p>The <i>Territelari&aelig;</i> [or underground weavers] are distinguished
from all other spiders by the position of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[ 76 ]</a></span>
their falces,<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> which have the fang directed downwards,
and move vertically parallel to one another. Thus
when a victim is seized by one of the <i>Territelari&aelig;</i> it
receives a downward blow, while other spiders strike
sideways, the falces moving in a horizontal or oblique
direction. With very few exceptions this sub-order
may also be known by the presence of four blotches
of paler colour at the base of the abdomen underneath,
indicating the position of four air-sacs, almost all, or
indeed perhaps all, other spiders having but two.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_48" id="Footnote_48"></a><a href="#FNanchor_48"><span class="label">[48]</span></a> Sometimes called mandibles. One of these is represented, enlarged, at
Fig. A 7. in <a href="#Plate_VII">Plate VII.</a>, p. 88.</p></div>

<p>Certain species of <i>Territelari&aelig;</i> are the only spiders
known to construct nests closed with a door, and these
creatures must be admitted to rank among the first
of Nature's handicraftsmen and inventors.</p>

<p>The geometrical webs of many common spiders
are very beautiful structures, but these are for the
most part only snares for prey, and not permanent
dwellings, although the cocoons in which the eggs
are placed are often most ingeniously contrived. Thus
in the south we may sometimes find an inverted balloon
of strong silk about an inch long attached to
heath and other bushes, which, if examined during
the winter, will be found to contain in its centre a
case enclosing a mass of eggs about one-third the bulk
of the entire cocoon. This inner case is shaped exactly
like the outer, and both have a circular silk lid
carefully closed, and the space between the two is
filled with a dense mass of golden-brown silk, which
acts no doubt as an excellent non-conductor. This
cocoon is the work of <i>Epeira fasciata</i>, a species apparently
only found in southern Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[ 77 ]</a></span></p>

<p>Other spiders again, such as <i>Theridion</i>,<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> suspend by
a long and delicate cord of silk a minute balloon,
scarcely larger than a seed-pearl, containing their
eggs, which sways to and fro in the lightest breath
of air. But admirable as these cocoons and geometrical
snares are, the homes of these and of spiders
generally do not exhibit much contrivance or ingenuity,
or cannot at any rate be ranked in the same category
as those of the trap-door spider. But it may be asked,
why should we admire the one more than the other,
since it is clear that the most squalid and mean-looking
nest exactly serves the purpose of its occupant,
whether for shelter or defence, and in many cases
a spider might even say with truth that as for her
home it would not be so safe if it were not so dirty.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_49" id="Footnote_49"></a><a href="#FNanchor_49"><span class="label">[49]</span></a> <i>Theridion variegatum</i> (Bl.). <i>Ero tuberculata</i>, Koch.</p></div>

<p>But the answer is simple: the trap-door spider's
dwelling is to that of common spiders what the
Mont Cenis tunnel is to other tunnels, and something
besides.</p>

<p>What delights us is to see how by clever contrivance
and great perseverance new and multiplied
difficulties have been overcome, and dangers avoided,
and the interest aroused is exactly proportionate to
the amount of these difficulties and dangers.</p>

<p>It is hoped that the following pages and their accompanying
illustrations will vindicate the claims of
these spiders to the marked attention and admiration
which is here asserted to be their due as architects
and engineers.</p>

<p>There is but one British or North European representative
of the <i>Territelari&aelig;</i>&mdash;namely, <i>Atypus piceus</i> (or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[ 78 ]</a></span>
<i>Sulzeri</i>),<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> and this creature does not appear to
deserve the name of trap-door spider, for in three
nests which M. H. Lucas kindly showed me, preserved
at the Jardin des Plantes at Paris, the mouth
of the tube was destitute of any covering. I gathered
from what I saw, and from what M. Lucas told
me, that these nests [which he had taken in the
neighbourhood of Paris], consist of a silk tube from
eight to ten inches long, of which about one inch
only at the lower extremity penetrates the earth, the
remainder being carried upwards in an irregular and
sinuous course among the stems and leaves of small
plants and grasses to which it is attached. When the
tube is removed from these supports it collapses, and
appears like a rather coarsely woven ribbon-shaped
strip of silk.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_50" id="Footnote_50"></a><a href="#FNanchor_50"><span class="label">[50]</span></a> Unless it should prove, as Prof. Ausserer suggests, that the British
<i>Atypus</i> is distinct from the Continental, when it would bear the name of
<i>Atypus Blackwallii</i>. (Ausserer, l. c. p. 17).</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_51" id="Footnote_51"></a><a href="#FNanchor_51"><span class="label">[51]</span></a> I have never been able to meet with an English specimen of the nest of
<i>Atypus</i>; but it would appear from the descriptions that the English differ
from the French nests in being subterranean, and in having the mouth of the
tube concealed by a loose flap of silk. Mr. Blackwall says: [Spiders of
Great Britain and Ireland, part i. p. 14] "Dr. Leech has taken specimens
of <i>Atypus Sulzeri</i> in the vicinity of London and Exeter. It excavates, in
humid situations, a subterraneous gallery, which is at first horizontal, but
inclines downwards towards its termination. In this gallery it spins a tube
of white silk, of a compact texture, about half inch in diameter....
Part of the tube hangs outside of the aperture to protect the entrance."
</p>
<p>
It would be interesting to learn whether these differences permanently
distinguish the English from the French nests, and if so, whether the spiders
which construct them are not, as Prof. Ausserer is inclined to believe, distinct
also.</p></div>

<p>Four types of trap-door nest, properly so called, may
now be distinguished in the world at large, and these
are represented diagrammatically in the following
woodcut.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_52" id="Footnote_52"></a><a href="#FNanchor_52"><span class="label">[52]</span></a> Where all the figures, except C 1, and D 1, which are of the natural
size, are reduced to about one-third of the actual size in large specimens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[ 79 ]</a></span></p></div>

<p>Of these two only (A and B) were known up to
the present time, the construction of which is much
simpler than that of the two new types (C and D),
which I have hitherto only found at Mentone and
Cannes.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_53" id="Footnote_53"></a><a href="#FNanchor_53"><span class="label">[53]</span></a> It must not be supposed that I have a sole or prior claim to what may
prove to be new and of interest in the following observations on the Trap-door
Spiders of the Riviera. This priority belongs to the Hon. Mrs. Richard
Boyle, to whom I owe it that I ever took up the subject. It was, thanks to
her guidance, that I first became acquainted with these marvellously-concealed
nests in their native haunts, and to her active help that I finally
arrived at a comprehension of the different types of structure which they
present.</p></div>

<div id="Img_80" class="fig_center" style="width: 308px;">
<img src="images/page79.png" width="308" height="357" alt="" />
</div>

<p>It will be seen at a glance that A and B have but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[ 80 ]</a></span>
one door, while C and D have two, these latter having
a surface door, and also another door a short way
under ground.</p>

<p>All the nests consist of a tube excavated in the
earth to a greater or less depth, unbranched in all but
D, and in every case lined with silk, this lining being
continuous with the lining of the door or doors of
which it forms the hinge.</p>

<p>I have found it convenient to distinguish these
four types of nests by the following names:&mdash;A, the
single door cork nest, or shortly the cork nest; B, the
single door wafer nest; C, the double door unbranched
nest; and D, the double door branched nest.</p>

<p>The type B has only been found in the West India
Islands, and is chiefly distinguished from A by having
a thin and wafer-like door, wholly constructed of
silk, without admixture of earth, lying on rather
than fitting into the aperture of the tube; while in
A the door is much thicker, made of layers of earth
and silk, and so contrived that it tightly closes the
mouth of the tube, which is bevelled to receive it,
much as a cork closes the neck of a bottle.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_54" id="Footnote_54"></a><a href="#FNanchor_54"><span class="label">[54]</span></a> Nests belonging to the type A,
 are represented in Plates <a href="#Plate_VII">VII., p. 88</a>,
and <a href="#Plate_VII">VIII., p. 94.</a></p></div>

<p>The West Indian nests are of a much tougher and
coarser texture than those which I have seen in
Europe, and vary somewhat in the shape of their
tube, which is curved or straight, and sometimes has
near its lower extremity a short spur-shaped enlargement,
giving to the whole a ludicrous resemblance
to a stocking, of which this spur is the heel.</p>

<p>Mr. Gosse,<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> in his <i>Naturalist's Sojourn in Jamaica</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[ 81 ]</a></span>
has given an admirable description of one of these
single door wafer nests, the work of <i>Cteniza nidulans</i>,
which I cannot do better than quote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_55" id="Footnote_55"></a><a href="#FNanchor_55"><span class="label">[55]</span></a> Gosse (P. H.), Naturalist's Sojourn in Jamaica (1851), p. 115-118. See
also for another description of the same nest Latreille's Vues G&eacute;n&eacute;rales sur
les Araneides, in the Nouv. Ann. du Mus&eacute;um (Paris, 1832), tom. i. p. 73-4.</p></div>

<p>The nest is "cylindrical, or nearly so, from four to
ten inches deep, and about one inch in diameter; the
bottom is rounded; and the top, which is at the surface
of the soil, is closed very accurately with a circular
lid. They are not all equally finished, some being
much more compact, and having the lid more closely
fitted than others. Some have irregular bulgings, and
ragged laminated offsets on the outer surface; but all
are smooth and silky on the inside.... The mouth
of the tube, and the parts near it, are very strong;
the walls here often having a thickness of from one-eighth
to one-fourth of an inch; but the lower parts
are much thinner. The lid is continuous with the
tube for about a third of its circumference, and this
part may be called the hinge, though it presents no
structure peculiar to itself; it is simply bent at a right
angle, as is manifest, if a nest be cut longitudinally
through with scissors, the incision passing through
the midst of the lid. The mode of construction, I
judge, from examination of many nests, to be this.
The spider digs a cylindrical hole in the moist earth,
with her jointed fangs or mandibles, carrying out the
fragments as they are dislodged. When the excavation
has proceeded a little way, she begins to spin the
lining which forms the dwelling. I conclude thus,
because nests are occasionally found a few inches in
length, with the lid and upper part perfect, but without
any bottom, these being evidently in the course of
formation. I suppose that she weaves her silk at first
in unconnected patches, against the earthy sides,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[ 82 ]</a></span>
perhaps where the mould is liable to fall in; and thus
I account for the loose rough lamin&aelig; of silk that are
always found projecting from the outer surface. These
are overlaid with other patches more and more extensive,
until the whole interior walls are covered;
after which the silk is spun evenly and continuously
all round the interior, in successive layers of very dense
texture, though thin. Under the microscope, with a
power of 220 diameters, these layers are resolved into
threads laid across each other and intertwined in a
very irregular manner; some are simple, varying from
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>7000</sub> to <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2000</sub> of an inch in diameter, and others are
compound, several threads, in one part separate, being
united into one of greater thickness which cannot then
be resolved.... The mouth of the tube is commonly
dilated a little, so as to form a slightly recurved
brim or lip; and the lid is sometimes a little convex
internally, so as to fall more accurately into the mouth
and close it.</p>

<p>"The thickening of the hinge by additional layers is,
I think, accidental only, as, out of the many specimens
that I have examined, only one or two had such a
structure. In the neatest examples, the lid is of equal
thickness throughout its extent, agreeing also with
the walls for the first few inches of their depth."</p>

<p>Mr. Gosse says that he possesses one specimen of
peculiar compactness, which differs from all the others
that he has examined in having "a row of minute
holes, such as might be made by a very fine needle,
pierced around the free edge of the lid, and a double
row of similar ones just within the margin of the
tube. There are about fifteen or sixteen punctures
in each series, and they penetrate through the whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[ 83 ]</a></span>
substance, the light being clearly seen through each
hole. I do not think, as I have somewhere seen
suggested, that they are intended to afford a hold for
the spider's claws when she would keep her door shut
against the efforts of an enemy, for what would be
the use of having them in the tube <i>close to the lid</i>, so
close that not the eighth of an inch intervenes between
the surface of the lid and that of the tube, when the
former is tightly closed? I would suggest whether
they may not be air-holes, for so tight is the fitting
of the lid, and so compact the texture of the material,
that I should suppose the interior would be impermeable
to air but for this contrivance."<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> "The spider
that inhabits this nest is black, with the thorax of an
exceedingly lustrous polish, its abdomen is full and
round, its legs very short."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_56" id="Footnote_56"></a><a href="#FNanchor_56"><span class="label">[56]</span></a> I cannot myself think this explanation probable, and should still be
inclined to consider these punctures to be the claw marks of the spider, as is
the case in some European nests.</p></div>

<p>Another form of this single door wafer nest is described
by Mr. Sells,<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> in which there is a hinge-like
thickening of the silk lining of the tube about an inch
below the actual hinge of the door, which it is suggested
may serve to give additional elasticity. This
was not found, however, in all the nests examined,
and Mr. Sells conjectures that in newly constructed
nests the lid may close sufficiently firmly without
this contrivance, and that it is only added in older
nests.</p>

Ent. Soc. ii. 207-210.</p></div>

<p>Patrick Browne's figure, to which reference has been
made above, represents a nest with two doors, one
applied against the other, at the mouth of the tube,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[ 84 ]</a></span>
and it has often been asked what this could possibly
mean.</p>

<p>Some have thought that the drawing was fanciful,
others that it was made from an abnormal or injured
nest. However, I believe that the drawing, though
rude, is, in fact, not very incorrect, and shows a case
of repair or enlargement of the nest, a subject to be
treated of more fully further on. There is a specimen
exhibited in the British Museum which in this respect
very nearly corresponds with Browne's figure; it is
labelled "Nest of Trap-door Spider with two doors,
from the spider having enlarged its abode.&mdash;Jamaica."
Here one sees that the spider has prolonged its tube
about half an inch beyond the original mouth of the
nest, where it has constructed a new mouth and door,
the old door standing straight up at the back of and
behind the new one.</p>

<p>I imagine that the explanation of this curious piece
of cobbling may be somewhat as follows:&mdash;When the
nest was in its original state and had but one door,
this door became by some accident covered over with
earth to about the depth of half an inch, and the inmate
was thus imprisoned. Then the spider, being,
like most other members of its order, very unwilling
to abandon its home, determined to clear away the
entrance to its nest, and to lengthen the tube so that
it should reach up to the new level of the surface of
the earth.... If I am right, this should rather be
called a lengthening than an enlargement of the tube.</p>

<p>The nests of the cork type (A, <a href="#Page_79">p. 79</a>) may usually be
distinguished at a glance from those of the wafer type
by the greater thickness of the door, and by its manner
of shutting, but a nest from Morocco has been figured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[ 85 ]</a></span>
and described by Prof. Westwood,<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> which seems intermediate
between the two. The door in this case
may perhaps be considered as of the cork type,
though it is very thin, for it does fit into the mouth
of the tube, which is bevelled to receive it.</p>

<p>I wish to take the present opportunity of thanking Prof. Westwood for
having afforded me special facilities for examining this and other specimens
forming part of the very valuable collections under his care at Oxford.</p></div>

<p>These nests were forwarded with their living occupants
(<i>Cteniza [Actinopus] &aelig;dificatorius</i>) from Tangiers
to Prof. Westwood, who describes the nests as being
"about four inches deep, slightly curved within, about
three quarters of an inch in diameter, the valve at the
mouth not being circular, but rather of an oval form,
one side where the hinge is placed being straighter
than the other. The valve is formed of a number of
layers of coarse silk, in the upper layers of which are
imbedded particles of the earth, so as to give the
cover the exact appearance of the surrounding soil,
the several successive layers causing it, when more
closely inspected, to resemble a small flattened oyster-shell."</p>

<p>The resemblance between this nest and that of the
West Indian species is the more interesting as Prof.
Westwood says that both belong to the same genus,
(<i>Cteniza</i> or <i>Actinopus</i> of different authors,) and are so
closely allied as to present scarcely any important
distinction but that of size.</p>

<p>We shall find, however, on comparing the nests of
these trap-door spiders and their occupants, that we
cannot as yet make any rule as to the kind of nest
which we may expect from a given spider.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[ 86 ]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be seen that species belonging to the same
genus, and closely resembling one another, sometimes
build dissimilar nests; while others, belonging to
different genera, and unlike in many important
respects, construct almost identical nests.</p>

<p>This is the more strange, because, if we examine
the structure of the claws and palpi, they often seem
to be specially adapted to serve as carding instruments
and to play a very important part in the weaving of
the silk linings of the nest; and yet nests of the same
type are occasionally produced by spiders in which these
appendages are quite unlike, and dissimilar nests where
the claws and palpi are to all appearance identical.</p>

<p>Thus, for example, if the reader will examine the
drawings of part of the foremost right foot of <i>Cteniza
fodiens</i>, figs. A, 9 and 10, <a href="#Plate_VII">Plate VII.</a>, p. 88, with that of
<i>Nemesia c&aelig;mentaria</i>, figs. A, 9 and 10, <a href="#Plate_VIII">Plate VIII.</a>, p. 94,
both of which make nests of the cork type, he will see
that in the former the last joint of the tarsus is armed
along the inner side, with many moveable spines, and
that each of the two curved terminal claws has only
one very strong tooth near the base; while the same
joint of the latter (<i>N. c&aelig;mentaria</i>) has no spines, and the
claws have three minute comb-like teeth near the base.</p>

<p>On the other hand, in the reverse case, where the
structure of the same joint is very similar, the nests
may be wholly unlike, as in <i>Nemesia Eleanora</i>, <a href="#Plate_XII">Plate
XII.</a>, p. 106, and <i>N. c&aelig;mentaria</i>, <a href="#Plate_VIII">Plate VIII.</a>, where the
nest of the former is of the double-door unbranched
type, and that of the latter of the single-door cork
type.</p>

<p>It is probable however that a fuller and closer
comparison of, and a more exact acquaintance with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[ 87 ]</a></span>
several parts and their functions might show us that
all spiders which spin similar webs are furnished with
equivalent instruments, so that what one leg lacks
another may possess in some shape or another; brushes
of stiff hairs in one place, compensating for a toothed
claw, or for a row of moveable spines in another.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_59" id="Footnote_59"></a><a href="#FNanchor_59"><span class="label">[59]</span></a> The claws are probably of first-rate importance in this respect and should
be most carefully studied. M. Lucas has stated that the claws of <i>Mygale
Blondii</i>, and <i>M. nigra</i> from Algiers, and of <i>M. nigra</i> and <i>M. avicularia</i> from
Brazil, are retractile like those of a cat! Unfortunately the dwellings of
these spiders have not been described. See Lucas (H.) in Rev. et Mag. de
Zoologie, s&eacute;r. 2, tom. ix. 1857, p. 587, and Ann. de la Soc. Entom. de France,
ser. 3, tom. v. p. cxx., and vi. p. clxxi. Another curious point in which
spiders differ is the presence or absence of viscidity in the hairs which clothe
their feet and palpi. Mr. Blackwall states (Spiders of Great Britain and
Ireland, vol. i. p. 13), that by far the greater number of the sub-order
<i>Territelari&aelig;</i>, or <i>Mygalid&aelig;</i> as he terms them, "have the inferior surface
of their biungulate tarsi, and of the digital joint of their pediform
palpi, in the females, densely clothed with compound, hair-like papill&aelig;,
constituting an apparatus which, by the emission of a viscous secretion,
enables them to traverse the perpendicular surfaces of dry, highly polished
bodies; others have three pairs of spinners and are destitute of hair-like
papill&aelig; on the legs and palpi."
</p>
<p>
The four species of trap-door spider on the Riviera, here described, appear
to form exceptions to this rule, however, for they all remained helpless
prisoners when placed in a glass tumbler, though struggling vigorously for
freedom.</p>

<p>When, however relying on this experience, I placed a number of smaller
spiders of different kinds in glasses for examination some walked straight
out without any difficulty, while others were unable to climb up the sides.</p></div>

<p>It would be interesting, from this point of view, to
draw all the parts which may be supposed to aid in the
act of weaving, and so to contrast the corresponding
limbs of different spiders, the nests of which are known,
that one might see at a glance in what they differed
and agreed. I have done this for the falces and the
last joint of the foremost right foot of the four spiders
figured in Plates <a href="#Plate_VII">VII.</a>, <a href="#Plate_VII">VIII.</a>,
<a href="#Plate_VII">IX.</a>, and <a href="#Plate_XII">XII.</a>, but to
make the case complete all the limbs should be represented
in the same way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[ 88 ]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the two spiders which are shown with their cork
nests in Plates <a href="#Plate_VII">VII.</a> and <a href="#Plate_VIII">VIII.</a>, the purplish grey
<i>Cteniza fodiens</i>, (<a href="#Plate_VII">Plate VII.</a>) appears to be much rarer
than the brown striped <i>Nemesia c&aelig;mentaria</i> (<a href="#Plate_VIII">VIII.</a>), at
any rate at Mentone. I have hitherto only succeeded
in obtaining four specimens of the former, though I
have searched repeatedly for them at Cannes and
Mentone, while the latter species is tolerably common.</p>

<p>The nests are, however, often extremely hard to
find, and in some cases it is only by chance that I have
been able to light upon them. All these trap-door
spiders seem usually to prefer rather moist and shady
places, and sloping banks or loose terrace walls where
the interstices between the stones are filled up with
earth, and concealment is afforded by the creeping
lycopodium (<i>Selaginella denticulata</i>), Ceterach, spleen-wort
or maiden-hair ferns, with short moss and splashes
of white lichen to distract the eye.</p>

<p>It was from such a terrace wall at Mentone, on March
26, 1872, that the nest A in <a href="#Plate_VII">Plate VII.</a> was taken,
the tube running obliquely back into the earth between
the stones, and the door being concealed by a net-work
of lycopodium, one spray of which had been allowed
to grow on its upper surface.</p>

<p>The tubes of these as of the other kinds of nest are
sometimes straight, but more frequently they are bent,
and almost always take a downward course.</p>

<p>The following is Mr. Pickard-Cambridge's description<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
of <i>Cteniza fodiens</i>, the spider which constructs
this nest.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_60" id="Footnote_60"></a><a href="#FNanchor_60"><span class="label">[60]</span></a> The following description and remarks, printed in a different type, have
been kindly prepared for this work by the Rev. O. Pickard-Cambridge, to
whom I sent a series of specimens of the spiders preserved in spirit of wine
and their nests. My very sincere thanks are due to Mr. Pickard-Cambridge
for this assistance, which will give to my publication a value in the eyes of
Arachnologists which it could not otherwise have possessed. To all those
who wish to study the true structural relations of the four spiders, the
habits of which are recorded in the following pages, these details will prove
of the highest importance; while those who are only interested in the
economy of these creatures can readily pass them over. For observers in
the field there is a very ready way of knowing these four spiders apart, as it
will be seen that when they are somewhat alike the nests are different
(<i>Nemesia meridionalis</i> and <i>N. Eleanora</i>), and when the nests are alike
(<i>Cteniza fodiens</i> and <i>Nemesia c&aelig;mentaria</i>) the spiders are markedly dissimilar.</p></div>

<p>Female adult length 10 lines.</p>

<p><i>Cephalothorax</i> oblong oval, somewhat truncate at each end, and
of a dull whitish-yellow brown colour, the normal grooves and
furrows are strongly marked, the caput is large and elevated,
rounded on the sides and slightly higher near the occiput than at
the ocular area, the junction of the thoracic segments is indicated
by a strong deep curved indentation, the curve directed backwards;
there are a few strong black bristles of different lengths within the
ocular space, and several others run backwards in the central line to
the occiput. The height of the Clypeus is equal to rather more than
the diameter of one of the foremost eyes. The <i>Eyes</i> are eight, and
form a rectangular figure whose transverse diameter is the longest,
and whose fore side is a little shorter than the hinder one; the longitudinal
diameter is about equal to the space between the two foremost
eyes; these are the largest of the eight, and are separated by
an interval of very nearly two eyes' diameters; the two central
eyes are the smallest, and are distant from each other just about
one eye's diameter, the eyes of the hinder row are in two pairs
forming the hinder corners of the rectangle, those of each pair are
nearly contiguous to each other, and the inner one of each is the
smallest; these last in the figure appear to be the smallest of the
eight, but this arises from the point of view whence the figure was
drawn; the two central eyes occupy as nearly as possible the centre
of the figure formed by the two foremost eyes, and the two inner
ones of the hinder row, and are seated on a large black spot. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[ 90 ]</a></span>
<i>Legs</i> are short, strong, and similar to the Cephalothorax in colour,
their relative length appeared to be 4, 3, 1, 2, they are furnished
with hairs, bristles, and short strong spines. These latter are on
those of the two first pairs, situated chiefly in two longitudinal
parallel rows beneath the tibi&aelig;, metatarsi, and tarsi; on those of
the third pair they are situated on the sides and upper sides of those
joints, while the fourth pair has them only beneath the metatarsi
and tarsi; all the tarsi terminate with three claws, the two superior
ones are much the longest and strongest, and have a single short
strong tooth inside near the base. Near the union of the femora
and genu&aelig; of the legs of the fourth pair are numerous short strong
spines, hairs, and bristles. The <i>Palpi</i> are similar in colour to the
legs; they are strong and about equal in length to the legs of the
second pair, and have a double longitudinal row of strong spines
widely separated and divergent from each other beneath them; the
digital joint (like the tarsi of the legs) is furnished with other
spines between these two rows; each palpus terminates with a single
untoothed curved claw. The <i>Falces</i> are strong, prominent, rounded
in the profile line, and have some hairs, bristles, and spines near
their fore extremities; the longest and strongest of the spines are
three in number, and form a kind of transverse row or comb at the
extreme inner point on the upper side of each falx; besides these
there is a row of short tooth-like spines on either margin of the furrow
on the under side of each falx in which the fang lies concealed
when at rest. The <i>Maxill&aelig;</i> are short and strong; the palpi issue
from their extremity on the outer side, and the inner extremity is
somewhat prominent and pointed.</p>

<p>The <i>Labium</i> is small, short, somewhat rectangular in form, and
broader than high; the apex is a little rounded, and furnished
with a single transverse row of small tooth-like spines.</p>

<p>The <i>Sternum</i> is somewhat subtriangular in form, much broader
behind, where it is rounded on the outer angles.</p>

<p>The <i>Abdomen</i> is short oval, very convex above, where it is of a
yellowish vinous brown colour, with a slightly darker longitudinal
tapering, indistinct central stripe on the fore part; it is sparingly
clothed with hairs, and the under side is of a pale dull yellowish
colour; the spinners are four in number, and those of the superior
pair are the strongest, three jointed and upturned.</p>

<p>Adults and immature examples (all females) were found in
tubular holes lined with silk and closed at the orifice with a strong
solid hinged lid, shutting into the opening like a cork.</p></div>

<p>The portions of nests at B and C in <a href="#Plate_VII">Plate VII.</a>
also belong to <i>Cteniza fodiens</i>, the latter being very
similar to A in its surroundings, but having a
rather thinner door, slightly hollowed out above
(C 1). The smaller nest shown shut at B and
open at B 1,<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> is admirably concealed by mosses and
lichens, some of which actually grow upon the door,
and here two minute trap-doors, belonging to infantine
examples of a distinct species of spider (<i>Nemesia
meridionalis</i>), are seen on the left hand below.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_61" id="Footnote_61"></a><a href="#FNanchor_61"><span class="label">[61]</span></a> It must be clearly understood that when the doors are represented as
standing open or ajar this is unnatural, as they always close by their own
combined weight and elasticity.</p></div>

<p>It is not rare to find small colonies of nests of the
same or distinct species grouped closely together in
this way, though I greatly doubt whether one can
safely assume their sociability from this fact.</p>

<p>I have very seldom seen nests on the flat ground,
where the door would lie horizontally when closed, a
sloping or nearly vertical bank being usually chosen,
where the door will fall to by its own weight.</p>

<p>In the Ionian Islands another species or variety of
<i>Cteniza</i>, described under the name of <i>Cteniza (<span class="antiqua">or</span>
Mygale) ionica</i>, and represented as being of an uniform
yellow-brown colour, is said to make its nests in the
earth of the terraces round the roots of the olive
trees.</p>

<p>Mr. Saunders<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> gives admirable figures and descriptions
which show us at once that these nests, which
he discovered in rather elevated situations in the island
of Zante, are of the cork type; but, in this case, the
entire door does not shut flush with the surface, as in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[ 92 ]</a></span>
ordinary cork nests, but has a short spur-like projection
above and behind the hinge, serving, as is conjectured,
like a lever, by pressing on which from the
outside the lid may easily be raised.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> When I come
to speak of the manner of constructing and repairing
nests I shall have occasion to refer to these nests
again.</p>

<p>I have not as yet found any nests on the Riviera
which can be said to correspond accurately with those
of <i>Ct. ionica</i>, the only builders of cork nests yet discovered
in this district being <i>Cteniza fodiens</i> and
<i>Nemesia c&aelig;mentaria</i>.</p>

<p>This latter species is described by Mr. Pickard-Cambridge,<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
in the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>M. c&aelig;mentaria</i> (Walck), <i>Ins. Apt.</i> i. p. 135.</p>

<p>Female adult, length 9 to 11 lines.</p>

<p><i>Cephalothorax</i> rather elongate, oval, and somewhat truncated
at each extremity; the caput is elevated and rounded on the sides
and upper part, but less elevated than in <i>Cteniza</i>; the normal
grooves and indentations are well marked, and the junction of the
cephalic and thoracic segments is indicated by a strong deep impression
or cleft, of a transverse, curved, or somewhat bent angular
form, the curve or angle directed forwards. The colour of the
cephalothorax is yellow-brown tinged with olive, the margins are
paler, but have no distinctly defined marginal band. On the
hinder part of the caput are three clear brown-yellow longitudinal
stripes; the central one reaches from behind the two hind central
eyes to the thoracic junction, the lateral ones converge a little to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[ 93 ]</a></span>
the same point, but do not reach nearly, in fact not much more
than half way, to the eyes. The clypeus is of a clear brown-yellow
colour also, and on either side of it (extending from each fore
lateral eye), is an irregular patch of the same. The ocular region
and clypeus are furnished with a few strongish black bristles, and the
three yellow stripes above mentioned have a few more, those on
the central stripe being the longest and strongest, and disposed in
a single longitudinal row.</p>

<p>The <i>Eyes</i>, eight in number, are seated on a transverse oval
eminence, and form a rectangular figure, whose transverse diameter
is double the length of its longitudinal diameter: their relative
position is similar to that of <i>Cteniza</i>, but in the present species
they are smaller than in <i>C. fodiens</i>: those of the hind central pair
are the smallest of the eight, and each is very nearly contiguous
to the hind lateral on its side; the interval between those of each
lateral pair is small; the space between the two central eyes of the
eight is equal to an eye's diameter, and each of these is separated
from the hind central and fore lateral nearest to it by a similar
interval. The <i>Legs</i> are strong, moderately long, their relative
length 4, 1, 3, 2?, but little difference is observable between 1, 3,
and 2; they are furnished with hairs, bristles, and a few, not very
strong, spines; each tarsus terminates with three curved claws, the
two superior ones much the longest and strongest, and have a few
small teeth near their base inside.</p>

<p>The <i>Palpi</i> are strong and similar in colour and armature to the
legs; each is terminated with a curved black claw.</p>

<p><i>Falces</i> strong, prominent, and rounded in the profile line; they
are furnished with hairs, bristles, and strong tooth-like spines; the
four strongest of these latter form a transverse row at the inner
extremity of each; besides these there is a row of short tooth-like
spines on the inner margin of the furrow on the underside of
each falx, in which the fang lies concealed when at rest. The
<i>Maxill&aelig;</i> are strong, with a small angular prominence at their inner
extremities (when looked at from beneath), and each has three to
four small dark-coloured teeth in a short, straight, obliquely transverse
row at the base on the inner side. <i>Labium</i> broad but short,
its breadth is double its height, and the upper corners are rounded
off. The <i>Sternum</i> is of a somewhat pentagonal form.</p>

<p><i>Abdomen</i> rather elongate oval, tolerably, but not excessively,
convex above; it is of a dull yellowish whitey-brown colour
marked and mottled above with dark chestnut brown; the markings
are rather irregular, but a general disposition in the form of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[ 94 ]</a></span>
a longitudinal central, and oblique lateral, stripes or bars may be
traced on the hinder half; the superior spinners are short and
three-jointed, those of the inferior pair are exceedingly minute.</p>

<p>Adult females were found in nests similar to those of <i>Cteniza
fodiens</i>.</p></div>

<p>The cork nests are the simplest form of nest, with
the exception of those described above from Jamaica,
and have constituted, up to the present time, the only
type known in Europe. Their chief claims to our
admiration lie in the perfection of workmanship which
the doors usually exhibit, and the marvellous concealment
which they afford when closed. These doors as
a rule fit so tightly [thanks to the accurate adjustment
of their sloping sides to the bevelled lip of the tube
which receives them,] that they afford a certain amount
of mechanical resistance, even when the spider is
away. But, after examining a very large series of
these cork nests, I find that there is some variation in
the degree of perfection attained in their work by
different individuals of the same kind. The mechanical
resistance is greater or less in proportion to the thickness
and weight of the door, and to the slope of its
sides, and of the bevelled edges of the tube; and in
each of these details a marked difference may be
observed.</p>

<p>One might suppose from what has so often been
repeated as to the habits of <i>N. c&aelig;mentaria</i>, that, whenever
any one attempts to open the door, the spider,
which is always at home in the day time, would dart
up from the bottom of the tube and endeavour to
keep it closed by holding on from within.</p>

<p>I cannot say what may take place during the summer
months; but from October to May I have but rarely
found one of these spiders ready to oppose me, though
<i>Nemesia meridionalis</i> and <i>N. Eleanora</i> frequently
did so. Many times, wishing to provoke them, I have
tapped at the door in order to apprise the occupant of
my arrival, or lifted it and let it fall again, and always
in vain, though the spider was there, crouching at
the bottom of her tube.</p>

<p>Indeed I can only recall six or eight instances in
which this spider did hold down her door, and on
three of these she was captured.</p>

<p>I will now relate what I saw on one of these
occasions,<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> for there has been much speculation as to
the manner in which the spider clings to the door and
offers the determined resistance which is experienced.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_65" id="Footnote_65"></a><a href="#FNanchor_65"><span class="label">[65]</span></a> Mrs. Boyle was the first to witness this curious sight, and my description
of the resistance of the spider is almost an exact repetition of hers to
me. It is curious also that, following her indications, I found the very nest
and spider on which she had made her observations, and every detail
recurred again though several days had elapsed between her visit and mine.</p></div>

<p>No sooner had I gently touched the door with the
point of a penknife than it was drawn slowly downwards,
with a movement which reminded me of the
tightening of a limpet on a sea-rock, so that the crown
which at first projected a little way above, finally lay
a little below the surface of the soil. I then contrived
to raise the door very gradually, despite the strenuous
efforts of the occupant, till at length I was just able
to see into the nest, and to distinguish the spider
holding on to the door with all her might, lying back
downwards, with her fangs and all her claws driven
into the silk lining of the under surface of the door.
The body of the spider was placed across, and filled
up, the tube, the head being away from the hinge, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[ 96 ]</a></span>
she obtained an additional purchase in this way by
blocking up the entrance.</p>

<p>I did not force the spider to release her hold, but,
by a rapid stroke with a long-bladed knife, cut out the
upper part of the tube with the surrounding mass of
soil, and thus secured the trap-door and its owner.
This specimen is represented at fig. C, <a href="#Plate_VIII">Plate VIII.</a>,
where the pin-point holes made by the claws may be
seen in pairs round the whole circumference of the
flatter portion of the lower surface of the door except
on the side next to the hinge.</p>

<p>Whenever a spider resists in this way she must
make these holes, but I have very rarely seen them
in other nests; this may perhaps be accounted for by
their having been effaced by the action of moisture
which would stretch the silk. However this may be,
this specimen showed the claw marks quite distinctly
on my return to England after the lapse of several
weeks.</p>

<p>Much has been written about these marks, which
are frequently spoken of as holes purposely made in
the silk in order to give the spider a better purchase.
It has also been stated that two holes may be seen in
the silk of the tube near the mouth on the side away
from the hinge, but these I have never been able to find.
The door of nest A in <a href="#Plate_VIII">Plate VIII.</a> is rather abnormal,
as it is made up of two doors, the smaller one being
spun into the top of the one now in use. This is, I
believe, an abnormal and rather clumsy example of
the ordinary way of enlarging the nest, but of
this we shall see more when we come to speak of
the construction and repairing of these nests generally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[ 97 ]</a></span></p>

<p>Fig. B in this plate represents a moss-covered sod
pierced by the tube of a nest, the door of which is
entirely concealed from view, and only discovered
when opened as at B 1.</p>

<p>This nest was found accidentally by Mr. Robert
Lightbody, who kindly brought it to me, its presence
having been betrayed by the tube, which he happened
to cut through in digging up a plant. The moss on
the door grew as vigorously, and had in every way
the same appearance, as that which was rooted in the
surrounding earth; and so perfect was the deception
that I found it impossible to detect the position of
the closed trap even when holding it in my hand.
There can be no doubt that many nests escape observation
in this way, and the artifice is the more surprising
because there is strong reason to believe that this
beautiful door-garden is deliberately planted with
moss by the spider, and not the effect of a mere
chance growth. I shall adduce evidence in support
of this statement by-and-by.</p>

<p>I alluded to the nest C (<a href="#Plate_VIII">Plate VIII.</a>) when speaking
of the claw marks which it exhibits, and that
figured at D and D 1 in this plate is merely an instance
of a good example of this type. I have taken
nests of <i>N. c&aelig;mentaria</i> both at Cannes and Mentone,
and have little doubt that this species will be discovered
at many points along the Riviera. I detected
two abandoned nests of the cork type, which I fully
expect had belonged to <i>N. c&aelig;mentaria</i>, in an enclosed
space called the Campagne de Garonne in Marseilles
itself. These nests lay in the little mound of undisturbed
earth between the divided trunks of the small
olive-trees, and I do not doubt that if I had had time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[ 98 ]</a></span>
to search I should have discovered more nests, and
perhaps others which were still tenanted.</p>

<p>We now turn from the single-door nests to those
with double doors, and from the well known to the
new types of structure.</p>

<p>In these we have a thin and wafer-like door at the
mouth of the nest, and from two to four inches lower
down, a second and solid underground door. These
lower doors are characteristic of the nests to which
they belong, that of the branched nest (<i>Nemesia meridionalis</i>,
<a href="#Plate_IX">Plate IX.</a>) being long and more or less
tongue-shaped, while that of the unbranched double-door
nest (<i>N. Eleanora</i>, <a href="#Plate_XII">Plate XII.</a> p. 106) is somewhat
horse-shoe shaped.</p>

<p>The surface doors of these two kinds of nest do not
appear to differ, and, though rather thinner, may be
compared to those of the single-door wafer kind from
Jamaica.</p>

<p>The commonest form at Mentone is the branched
nest, which may be found in abundance in many of
the loosely-built walls of the lemon and olive terraces
or on sloping banks, but they are rarely to be
met with on flat ground.</p>

<p>In the nests of <i>Nemesia meridionalis</i> the tube,
instead of being simple, as it is in all other known
nests, is invariably branched, a second tube joining
the first at the point where the lower door is hung
and forming with it an angle of about 45&deg;. The main
tube descends and is frequently curved, or sometimes
doubly bent like the spout of a tea-kettle (A, <a href="#Plate_X">Plate X.</a>
p. 100), while the branch ascends, and in some few
instances reaches the surface, though it is usually a <i>cul
de sac</i> (<a href="#Plate_IX">Plate IX.</a>)</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[ 99 ]</a></span></p>

<p>In the exceptional cases where the nests have two
superficial openings, one of the two surface doors
always appears neglected and going to decay, or is
covered with earth which chokes the upper part of
its tube. The explanation of this probably is that
the spider found the original entrance blocked up or
in some way unfitted for use, and then prolonged
what was the blind branch until it reached the surface
and replaced the former doorway. However this
may be it is certain that in the great majority of
nests it will be found that the branch ends in the
earth, and is a <i>cul de sac</i>, and this I have invariably
observed to be the case in the nests of very young
spiders of this species (fig. B, <a href="#Plate_IX">Plate IX.</a>)</p>

<p>The tube is frequently enlarged at the mouth, and
forms a spreading lip which the surface door is usually
large enough to cover (A 1, <a href="#Plate_IX">Plate IX.</a>)</p>

<p>In these branched double-door nests the upper door
does not fit into, but merely lies upon, the mouth of
the tube, the elasticity of the hinge and its own weight
being sufficient to keep it closed. The lower door is
suspended by a hinge placed at the apex of the angle
formed by the bifurcation of the tube, and is hung in
such a manner that it can either be pushed upwards
so as to lie diagonally across and block the main tube,
or be drawn back so as to fit into and close the
entrance to the branch.</p>

<p>This will, I think, best be understood by reference
to the drawings of a small nest of this type given at
B 1 and B 2 in <a href="#Plate_XI">Plate XI.</a> p. 105, where the second door
is shown in its two positions. This lower door is from
1 to 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> lines thick, channeled above, but nearly flat
on the back, and of an elliptic form, with a loose appendage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[ 100 ]</a></span>
at its lower end, the whole being made of
earth enclosed in a case of silk.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> When the lower
door is drawn back so as to close and conceal the entrance
to the branch, it lies in the same plane, and
closely corresponds in curvature with the lining of
the main tube and almost appears to form part of it
(fig. A, <a href="#Plate_X">Plate X.</a> p. 100, and fig. B 1, <a href="#Plate_XI">Plate XI.</a> p. 105).</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_66" id="Footnote_66"></a><a href="#FNanchor_66"><span class="label">[66]</span></a> Since writing the above I have learned, thanks to a better method which
I have recently adopted for preserving the nests for examination, that sometimes
the lower door, instead of being free within the tube and only attached
to the lining by the hinge, is surrounded on either side by a delicate silk
web, which extends from either edge of its lower surface to the silk walls of
the tube below and forms a sort of double gusset. This admits of the
movement of the lower door in the way described above, but perhaps serves,
together with the solid appendage at the extremity of the free end of the door
(that away from the hinge), to prevent the door from being driven too far in
an upward direction and thus becoming so tightly jammed as to make the
spider a prisoner in her own nest. I think it possible that the lower door
is always attached to the tube in this way, but, as it parts readily from the
silk on either side when the earth which supports the tube is removed, it
very frequently appears to be free, as I have represented it in Plates <a href="#Plate_IX">IX.</a>,
<a href="#Plate_X">X.</a>, and <a href="#Plate_XI">XI.</a></p></div>

<p>When digging out these nests, after carefully removing
the upper portion, I have frequently seen the
lower door move across and block up the main tube
in a mysterious manner, it being in reality pushed by
the spider from below, and she may sometimes be captured
at her post with her back set against the door.
More frequently, when the spider finds that resistance
is hopeless and sees the earth crumbling in, she drops
to the bottom of her nest and lies there helpless, with
her legs folded against her body like an embryonic
creature; some, however, more savage than their
neighbours, fly out and strike at the intruder with
their fangs.</p>


<div id="Plate_X" class="fig_center" style="width: 613px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[ 101 ]</a></span></p>

<p>What then, it may be asked, is the use of the
branch? I do not think that we can draw any safe
conclusion from what takes place when we dig out a
spider, as to what would occur if she were besieged by
one of her natural enemies, such as ichneumons, sand-wasps,
centipedes (<i>Scolopendra</i>), small lizards &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_67" id="Footnote_67"></a><a href="#FNanchor_67"><span class="label">[67]</span></a> For some account of the principal enemies of spiders generally, see <a href="#Page_134">p. 134</a>.</p></div>

<p>Let us suppose, however, that one of these creatures
has found its way into the nest and is crawling down
the tube. What will probably happen? Why, in
the first place, the spider will slam the second door in
the face of the intruder, and then, if worsted in the
pushing match which follows, quickly draw this door
back again and run up into the safety branch, when
the enemy, after descending precipitately to the bottom
of the main tube, will look in vain for the spider as
it searches on its way up for the secret passage now
closed by its trap-door. This is but a purely imaginary
case, and it may be that the branch has some wholly
different purpose.</p>

<p>It seems very improbable, however, that it should
be mainly intended as a safety place for the eggs or
offspring; at least if this were the case we should not
expect to find it, as we do, in the nests of very young
spiders (fig. B, <a href="#Plate_IX">Plate IX.</a>), which could have no use
for it.</p>

<p>The large spider and its nest figured at A and A 3
in <a href="#Plate_IX">Plate IX.</a> were taken at Mentone on March 17,
1872, and the following is the technical description of
the species, written by Mr. Pickard-Cambridge:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p><span class="smcap">Nemesia Meridionalis.</span> <a href="#Plate_IX">Plate IX.</a></p>

<p>Syn. <i>Mygale meridionalis</i> (Costa). <i>Fauna del Regno di Napoli</i>,
p. 14, Pl. I., figs. 1-4, ad partem.</p>

<p>Female adult, length 11 to 13 lines.</p>

<p>This spider is very nearly allied to <i>N. c&aelig;mentaria</i> both in
general structure and colours, but it may be distinguished by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[ 102 ]</a></span>
more elongate form both of the cephalothorax and abdomen; the
colours also of the present species are more distinctly distributed; a
well-defined narrow marginal band, irregular on the inside, surrounds
the thorax; and the caput has a large curved patch of the same
on either side of the ocular area, with a broad tapering band tinged
with orange, which runs from immediately behind the eyes to the
thoracic junction, where it ends in a point. The transverse diameter
of the ocular area is also less in proportion to its longitudinal
diameter than in <i>N. c&aelig;mentaria</i>, and the eyes are all smaller, but
placed on a similar oval eminence, and several bristles are directed
forwards from the middle of the lower margin of the clypeus, while
one or two others are found in the ocular area, and three or four
more (long, strong, and nearly erect) form a longitudinal row
along the middle of the central tapering thoracic band. The <i>Falces</i>
are deeply yellow-brown, with two to three elongate oval patches
or short longitudinal parallel bands on their upper sides; in their
armature the falces are similar to those of <i>N. c&aelig;mentaria</i>. The
<i>Labium</i> appeared to be less broad in proportion to its height, and
the <i>Sternum</i> smaller and of a more oval form than in that species.
The <i>Abdomen</i> is similarly marked, though the chocolate-brown
markings appeared to be less deep and dense, being more broken
up, but still forming several fairly defined, bold, and broad angular
bars or chevrons on the upper side. The inferior spinners, though
small (like most of the corresponding pair in species of this family),
are yet considerably stronger than in <i>N. c&aelig;mentaria</i>.</p>

<p>Adult females of this spider were found in tubular silk-lined
holes in the earth, closed at the external orifice with a flat scale-like
hinged lid, covered with lichens and mosses. Not quite half
way down this tube is a tubular branch running off upwards at an
angle of 45&deg; or less; the main tube also at this point is furnished
with an elliptical-hinged valve, with which the spider appears to
have the power to close the entrance to the branch or to shut off
the upper part of the main tube. This branch (found also in the
tubes of very young examples) seems to be certainly a strong distinguishing
character in the economy of the species, and separates
it at once from <i>N. c&aelig;mentaria</i>. In the nest of <i>N. meridionalis</i> the
tube also projects at times above the surface of the soil upwards
among the herbage which serves to conceal it. Costa appears to
have had before him this latter species as well as what is here
taken as the typical <i>N. meridionalis</i>, as he speaks of the nests
under his observation as being frequently branched, while his
description would suit both species; his figure, however, more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[ 103 ]</a></span>
nearly agrees in the thoracic pattern with the spider above described.
Ausserer, in his elaborate paper on the Mygalides, lately
published (<i>Beitr&auml;ge</i> &amp;c. vide supra), appears to have overlooked
<i>M. meridionalis</i> (Costa) altogether; while Canestrini and Pavesi
(<i>Catal. degli Araneidi italiani</i> in <i>Atti Soc. Ital. Sc. Nat.</i> xi. (1869)),
p. 25, include it under the synonyms of <i>M. fodiens</i> Walck., from
which it is undoubtedly distinct, as may be seen at once, even if it
were only by the difference in the form and structure of the lid
with which the external orifice of the tubular nest is closed.</p></div>

<p>In the case of the upper door of these branched
nests, as there is but a very thin coating of earth on
their upper surface, it is rare to find any of the larger
mosses or lichens growing upon them; but, as if to
compensate for this deficiency, a variety of foreign
materials are employed which are scarcely ever found
in cork doors, such as dead leaves, bits of stick, roots,
straw of grasses, &amp;c., and I have even seen freshly-cut
green leaves, apparently gathered for the purpose,
spun into a door which had recently been constructed.</p>

<p>But here again there is the widest possible difference
between nest and nest in the degree of perfection in
their concealment; and, although as a rule the surface
of the upper door harmonizes well with the general
appearance of its surroundings, there are some individual
nests in which it readily catches the eye and
even attracts attention.</p>

<p>Thus, I have seen nests in mossy banks where the
doors, being made of nothing but earth and silk,
showed distinctly as brown patches against the green;
and those doors which are covered with earth only,
even when they are surrounded by earth, are often
easily detected, because when they dry up, as they
quickly do, they become much paler in colour than
the earth of the bank, which retains its moisture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[ 104 ]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps in no case is the concealment more complete
than when dead leaves are employed to cover the door.
In some cases a single withered olive leaf only is spun
in and suffices to cover the trap; in others, several are
woven together with bits of wood and roots, as in the
accompanying woodcut, which represents different
views of the upper door of the nest which is drawn
in <a href="#Plate_X">Plate X.</a> p. 100.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[ 105 ]</a></span></p>

<p>In this nest another interesting feature presents
itself, for here the tube projects a short way beyond
the surface of the ground and is hardened and coated
with earth and fine gravel in such a way that it
requires no other support. This is not commonly the
case, and may perhaps be the result of a contrivance
to meet the necessities of a nest which has had the
surface earth washed away from it. But I have frequently
observed nests in which the upper part of the
tube is carried up for two or three inches through
grass, moss, ferns, pellitory, or the like, the stems of
the sheltering plants being interwoven with and made
to support the tube.<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> In every case the second door,
which is designed for resistance and requires a firm-walled
tube into which it may be wedged, is below
ground, and for the same reason we scarcely ever
find cork nests constructed with any part of the tube
projecting beyond the surface of the soil.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_68" id="Footnote_68"></a><a href="#FNanchor_68"><span class="label">[68]</span></a> This a&euml;rial portion of the tube corresponds with that of <i>Atypus piceus</i>
described above (<a href="#Page_78">p. 78</a>), but differs in having its aperture closed by a door.</p></div>

<p>At fig. A, <a href="#Plate_XI">Plate XI.</a>, one of these branched nests is
seen concealed in a plant of ceterach fern, and here
the tube is raised a short way above the soil; while
in fig. B of the same plate the common form is
represented, the upper door lying flat on the surface
of the ground, from which, thanks to its covering of
small mosses, it is scarcely to be distinguished.</p>

<p>The figs. B 1 and B 2 show this door open and the
lower door in its two positions.</p>

<p>Now that attention has been drawn to the existence
of this new type of nest, I fully expect that <i>Nemesia
meridionalis</i> will be found at many points along the
Riviera and in the whole Mediterranean region, but
I have hitherto only discovered it at Mentone and
Cannes. Mrs. Boyle saw one of these nests in the
Pallavicini gardens near Genoa, and there seems every
reason to believe that certain nests which have been
detected near Naples and in Ischia, will, when better
known, be found to be of the branched double-door type.</p>

<p>It seems probable that our spider belongs to the
species which was first described by M. Costa,<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[ 106 ]</a></span>
the name of <i>Mygale meridionalis</i>, though, if we are to
rely implicitly on the figures and detailed account
given by this naturalist, we must suppose that it constructs
a different nest in Southern Italy from that
which it makes on the Riviera, and one which,
although it agrees in most other respects, is destitute
of the characteristic subterranean door.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_69" id="Footnote_69"></a><a href="#FNanchor_69"><span class="label">[69]</span></a> Fauna del Regno di Napoli, (vol. containing <i>Animali Articolati</i>, classe ii.
Aracnidi: incomplete, Naples, 1861), p. 14, tab. i. figs. 1-4. See
<a href="#Appendix_A2">Appendix A</a>.</p></div>

<p>It is more likely, however, that M. Costa has overlooked
the existence of the lower door, though it is
strange that he should have done so, as he says that
the nests "sometimes have a double aperture, and the
upper portions of the burrows meet and anastomose
at about two inches distance," thus showing that he
was aware that the tube is branched.</p>

<p>One more nest only now remains to be described,
and this is again an example of a new type&mdash;namely, of
that which I have distinguished as the unbranched
double door (<a href="#Plate_XII">Plate XII.</a>), the work of <i>Nemesia
Eleanora</i>. This nest is never branched, and its second
and subterranean door is situated from one to four
inches below the surface door, and only serves to close
the one tube which is narrowed above the insertion of
this lower door. Here, as in the branched nest, the
thin and wafer-like surface door appears to serve
principally for concealment and the lower one for
resistance. This latter, made out of earth encased
in strong white silk, is from one to two lines thick,
and has, at the end away from the hinge, a similar
appendage to that found in the lower door of the
branched nest. This appendage serves, I imagine, as
a kind of ear by which the door, when firmly jammed
into the tube on the approach of an enemy, may be
pulled down again as soon as the alarm is over. As
in the branched nest it has the upper surface concave
and the lower slightly rounded, so that when
drawn back and not in use it may not obstruct the
passage. The sides of this lower door slope a little,
so that the crown is smaller than the base; and this
is important, because it causes the door to fit more
tightly when driven upwards into the tube, acting on
the principle of an inverted cork door.</p>


<div id="Plate_XII" class="fig_center" style="width: 445px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[ 107 ]</a></span></p>

<p>In form this door is somewhat elliptic, but much
broader and shorter than the second door of the
branched nest, and it is frequently of a nearly horse-shoe
shaped outline. The second door of the branched
nest is necessarily longer, having to perform the
double function of closing the opening to the branch
and the passage of the main tube.</p>

<p>In either case, however, these doors will be found to
be more or less elliptic, and this is necessarily so, for,
lying as they do when in use in a plane which cuts
the subcylindrical tube obliquely, they have to fill a
somewhat elliptical area.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_70" id="Footnote_70"></a><a href="#FNanchor_70"><span class="label">[70]</span></a> The lower door here, as in the branched nest (see above, <a href="#Page_100">p. 100</a>), is sometimes
united to the silk of the tube below by two nearly triangular gussets
of silk, when, instead of being free except at the hinge, as I have represented
it (<a href="#Plate_XII">Plate XII.</a>), it is surrounded on either side by silk and only free at the
extremity away from the hinge. This does not, however, alter the function
of this door in any way.
</p>

<p>It may be that these lower doors are always attached from below in this
way, but it is very difficult to be sure of this, as they readily break away
from the surrounding silk, when they appear quite free, as in my drawing.
It was not until I adopted the plan of stuffing the tube full of cotton wool
before removing the surrounding earth that I detected this fragile attachment.</p></div>

<p>I have observed some variation as to the exact
proportions of these doors, and it is quite possible
that in many cases they are specially adapted to meet
peculiarities in the curvature of the tube.</p>

<p>The nest and spider drawn at figs. A and A 3 of
<a href="#Plate_XII">Plate XII.</a> were first discovered by the Honourable Mrs.
Richard Boyle at Mentone, on March 26th, 1872, and
the following is the description of the species kindly
prepared by Mr. Pickard-Cambridge:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p><span class="smcap">Nemesia Eleanora</span>, sp. nov. <a href="#Plate_XII">Plate XII.</a></p>

<p>Female adult, length 11 to 12 lines.</p>

<p>This spider, which has (like <i>N. meridionalis</i>) probably been
confused with its near ally <i>N. c&aelig;mentaria</i>, is yet easily distinguished
from both by its deeper and richer colouring, as well as
by other characters.</p>

<p>The <i>Abdomen</i> has a far more spotted appearance; in some examples
a similar series of dark, broken, slightly angular bars is
indistinctly visible on the hinder half of the upper side; in others
(the more common type) the darker colouring preponderates, and
some transverse, broken, slightly angular, or nearly curved bars or
lines of pale spots constitute the pattern; the lateral margins of
the thorax are not so distinctly yellow as in <i>N. meridionalis</i>, and
there is a single longitudinal stripe on the caput, of a dull orange-yellow
brown, commencing directly behind the eyes and tapering
to the thoracic junction; the depression or pit at this point is more
strongly marked than in either of the two foregoing species; the
ocular area is also smaller, and its transverse diameter is less in
proportion to its width; the bristles on the margin of the clypeus,
as also those within the ocular area and in the central longitudinal
line of the caput, are similarly disposed to those in <i>N. meridionalis</i>,
but are more numerous; in some details, however, of form and
structure&mdash;viz., the Labium and Sternum&mdash;the present species is
more nearly allied to <i>N. meridionalis</i> than to <i>N. c&aelig;mentaria</i>. The
<i>Legs</i> seemed to be rather longer and stronger than in either; the
tarsi and metatarsi of the two first pairs, as well as the digital
joints of the palpi, are rather densely clothed a little underneath
on their outer sides with a kind of fringe or pad of close-set hairs;
in other respects the armature of the legs appeared to be similar
to that of the other two species, except that in the present one
there are three <i>short strong red-brown spines in a longitudinal row
on the outer sides of the genual joints of the third pair</i>; these spines
were plainly visible in all the examples found, but did not exist in
any one of those of the two former species. The armature of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[ 109 ]</a></span>
falces, which are of a uniform yellow-brown colour, is similar to
that of those species.</p>

<p>Adult females were found in tubular silk-lined unbranched holes,
closed at the orifice with a flat scale-like hinged lid concealed by
mosses and lichens, and having a horse-shoe shaped second valve or
door less than half way down the tube, of which it serves to shut off
the upper part. In this nest, as in that of <i>N. meridionalis</i>, the
upper part of the tube often projects above the surface of the soil.</p>

</div>

<p>Since the above description of the female of this species was
written, an example of the adult male has been most opportunely
discovered. It is much smaller than the female, its length being
only six lines. The <i>Cephalothorax</i> is of an uniform clear yellow-brown
colour, tinged with orange, and thinly clothed with a greyish
pubescence: the oblique indentations marking the union of the
cephalic and thoracic segments are indicated by a strongish black-brown
band on either side, which becomes obsolete as each approaches
the other near the central curved indentation; there are
also two or three converging suffused blackish stripes on the hinder
slope. The relative length of the <i>Legs</i> is the same in both sexes,
4, 1, 2, 3, but in the male those of the fourth are longer in
proportion to those of the third pair than in the female; the spines
also on the legs are more numerous and stronger, the upper sides
of the femora of all the legs are deeply suffused with black, while
in the female this suffusion is not nearly of so marked a character,
though the genua of the different females examined had a strong
brown-black macula on the outer side of each, while the corresponding
macul&aelig; in the single male examined were but just visible; the
three spines observed on the outer side of the genua of the third
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[ 110 ]</a></span>
pair of legs in the female are of even a more marked character in
the male, and hence they may be considered a good and tangible specific
difference from other nearly allied species; the tibi&aelig; of the first
pair are considerably enlarged on the under side at the fore extremity,
where each is armed with a single, longish, strong, slightly curved,
pointed black spine directed forwards (fig. <i>a</i>, 3). The <i>Abdomen</i> is small
and of an oval form; its colours and markings resemble those of the
female, but on the hinder half of the upper side two or three indistinctly
traced pale angular bars or chevrons are formed by the distribution
of the black-brown colours and markings; the under side of
the abdomen is of a uniform pale whitish yellow, except the spiracular
plates, which are yellow-brown. The <i>Palpi</i> are moderately long
and strong; the radial joint is longer than the cubital, and is of a
tumid and somewhat oval form, suffused over most of its surface
with dark brown, the rest of the palpus being of a yellowish-brown
colour; the digital joint is small and somewhat oblong-oval,
curved downwards, and very slightly concave on its inside; the
palpal organs consist of a nearly globular, basal, corneous bulb
prolonged into a strongish, curved, but not very long, pear-stem
form, the stem being distinctly cleft or bifid at its extreme
point (<i>vide</i> figs. <i>a</i> 1, and <i>a</i> 2), one portion of the bifid part is larger
than the other, though both are equal in length, and the stem of
the palpal bulb is directed transversely outwards, almost at right
angles with the digital joint.</p>

<p>Until the discovery of the male spider now described, and which
is, without doubt, the male sex of the female described immediately
before, this latter was thought to be the female of <i>Nemesia
Manderstjern&aelig;</i> (Ausserer), and it had indeed been so determined by
Professor Ausserer himself. But the form of the palpal organs
differs so decidedly from those of <i>N. Manderstjern&aelig;</i> (Ausserer,
<i>Beitr&auml;ge ... der Territelari&aelig;, Verhandl. Z. B. Gesllsch</i>: Wien,
1871, Bd. xxi. p. 170), that all doubts as to the present being a
distinct (and as it is believed to be) a hitherto undescribed species,
are removed. From M. Ausserer's description, the pear shaped
stem of the palpal bulb in <i>N. Manderstjern&aelig;</i> is comparatively
slender, ending in a fine and uncleft point, whereas, in <i>N. Eleanora</i>,
the stem is strong and its extremity cleft: other differences are
also observable in the two spiders, but this one is well marked and
the most tangible.</p>

<p>The specific name, <i>Eleanora</i>, now conferred upon the species, is
taken from the Christian name of the Hon. Mrs. Boyle, reference
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[ 111 ]</a></span>
to whom has been before made, and of whose kind exertions some
acknowledgment is thus permanently recorded.</p></div>

<p>In fig. A, <a href="#Plate_XII">Plate XII.</a>, the upper door, which, if
closed, would be entirely hidden by the long filmy
mosses which surround and cover it, is represented
open; but it should be clearly understood that this is
artificial and not natural, as in reality these doors
close of their own accord by means of their weight
and the elasticity of the hinge. It will be seen that
living mosses of two kinds are worked into the upper
surface of this door, which was admirably concealed.
(fig. A 1, <a href="#Plate_XII">Plate XII.</a>).</p>

<p>It is chiefly in the absence of the branch and the
different form of the lower door that the nest of
<i>Nemesia Eleanora</i> differs from that of <i>N. meridionalis</i>;
and, as they inhabit the same localities, it is
only when one has dug down as far as the lower
door that it can be known to which of the two species
the nest belongs. When once this point is reached
however, all doubt is at an end; for in this case the
unbranched double-door nest differs from the branched
in a way which any child could realize, though the
respective spiders are not very dissimilar when seen
with the naked eye alone. This affords a good
instance of the benefit which may accrue to a collector
from a study of the habits of the creatures which he
collects, for it is certain that it was the nest in this
case which first proclaimed the distinctness of its
tenant.</p>

<p><i>Nemesia Eleanora</i> is rather less common at Mentone
than <i>N. meridionalis</i>, but at Cannes I found the
reverse to be the case. At the latter place, on the
northern slope of the little hill of St. Cassien, branched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[ 112 ]</a></span>
and unbranched double-door nests may, however, be
found in tolerable abundance, the traps being frequently
concealed by fallen leaves from the cork oaks, which
are woven into their upper surface.</p>

<p>The nest of <i>N. Eleanora</i> often has the upper part
of the tube prolonged above the surface of the ground
and carried up through mosses, grasses, and the like.</p>

<p>An example of this is seen in figs. B and B 1, <a href="#Plate_XII">Plate XII.</a>,
in which the upper part of the tube is represented
with the surface door open in the one case and shut in
the other.</p>

<p>The concealment here was so complete that I should
never have discovered the nest but for the merest
accident. I happened to want some moss to lay with
flowers in my botanical tin, and in one handful which
I plucked up this trap-door lay concealed. It should
be observed that the upper part of the tube and its
surface door were covered with growing moss, and
this moss must have lived exclusively upon the moisture
which the very damp and shady situation afforded,
as there was no earth mixed with the silk.</p>

<p>When digging out the nests of <i>N. Eleanora</i>, I
have frequently seen the lower doors pushed forwards
so as to close the tube; and it is my belief that the
spider, after having thus barred the passage, puts her
back against the door and resists in this way. I must
own, however, that, though I believe I have seen the
spider in this attitude when I have severed the tube
from below, I am not quite certain about it.</p>

<p>I have twice in the months of April and May, and
frequently in October and November, found young of
this species in the nests with their mother. Usually
they were all very small and not larger than that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[ 113 ]</a></span>
represented at fig. B 2, <a href="#Plate_IX">Plate IX.</a>, p. 98, but occasionally
in October I have found two or three young
spiders thrice the size of their companions still in the
nest. On one occasion (in April) I found twenty-four
small spiders clustered beneath and beside their
mother.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> I secured the whole family by quickly
cutting out the mass of earth containing the lower door
on the under side of which they remained crouched,
and brought them home alive. I had up to this
time been in the habit of killing the spiders by placing
them in a stopper bottle full of strong spirit of wine,
but on treating these spiders in this way I saw
reason to regret having done so. I knew that these
large spiders, when thrown into spirit of wine, would
continue to struggle for an hour or more, spasmodically
spreading out their legs as if swimming; but I had
supposed that this was only muscular motion, and was
not in the least aware that the unfortunate creatures
were probably conscious all the while. In this
instance I first placed the mother spider in the bottle,
and then, after the lapse of about ten minutes, when
I supposed that the spider, though still struggling,
was dead to sense, I dropped in the young spiders.
No sooner, however, had I done this than the mother,
perceiving them, gathered all her young to her, and,
after placing them beneath her, with her legs drawn
up round them, as a hen screens her chickens with her
wings, never stirred again, and retained this attitude
until death released her, and the limbs, no longer under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[ 114 ]</a></span>
the control of this wonderful maternal resolution,
slackened and fell abroad.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_71" id="Footnote_71"></a><a href="#FNanchor_71"><span class="label">[71]</span></a> I have found similar families in October and November in the nests of
<i>N. meridionalis</i>, only all the young were of nearly uniform size, and very
small. On November 21 I dug out a mother spider of this species (<i>meridionalis</i>)
with forty-one little ones!</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_72" id="Footnote_72"></a><a href="#FNanchor_72"><span class="label">[72]</span></a> My own impression is that this act was one of conscious protection on
the part of the mother spider; but Mr. Pickard-Cambridge doubts this,
and would attribute the action to the tendency which spiders commonly
display to clutch at any material object when dying in this way.</p></div>

<p>I need scarcely say that the small spiders were
killed by the spirit in a very few instants, but
it is almost certain that the mother was alive
and conscious for half an hour. Now this pain can
easily be spared by placing large spiders for about
ten minutes in a closed box with a piece of cotton
wool steeped in chloroform beside them, before dropping
them into the spirit of wine, a system which I
have since that day adopted and found to answer
perfectly.</p>

<p>I examined these young spiders carefully, hoping
to detect some males among them, but the males,
though they differ markedly from the females when
adult in their smaller size and curiously enlarged
palpi, do not appear to afford any distinctive mark at
this early period. It appeared that these spiders had
been but recently hatched, for some among them
were still semi-transparent.</p>

<p>I have never found young spiders in the nests of
<i>Cteniza fodiens</i> or <i>Nemesia c&aelig;mentaria</i>.</p>

<p>M. de Walckenaer<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> quotes a statement made by
M. Rossi to the effect that <i>Cteniza fodiens</i> carries
its young on her back, as certain species of <i>Lycosa</i>
(Tarantula) do. He points out the interest which
would attach to this observation if confirmed, as showing
a similarity in habit between the two groups,
which are otherwise nearly related.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[ 115 ]</a></span></p></div>

<p>Observations of this kind are difficult to make satisfactorily,
at least in the case of the trap-door spiders
with which I am acquainted, and which appear to be
nocturnal in their habits. I have certainly never
seen them out of their nests in the daytime, and but
rarely detected one of them (<i>Nemesia c&aelig;mentaria</i>) even
venturing to peer out of her door set ajar for the
purpose.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_74" id="Footnote_74"></a><a href="#FNanchor_74"><span class="label">[74]</span></a> M. Olivier, however, states (Encyclop&eacute;die M&eacute;thodique, tom xviii.,
p. 228, Art. Araign&eacute;es Mineuses, Paris, 1811) that he has twice found nests
in the islands off Hy&egrave;res and on the promontory of St. Tropez the doors of
which were set open in the daytime and the tube empty, this seeming to
imply that the spiders were out hunting and were diurnal in their habits.
He did not see the spiders, but from his description the nest was of the cork
type.... Here is an interesting point, and one which those naturalists
who make Hy&egrave;res the field of their observations should endeavour to throw
further light upon.</p></div>

<p>The following very singular account is given by
M. Erber<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> of the habits of <i>Cteniza ariana</i>, which he
watched in the island of Tinos. I quote from the
abstract given in the <i>Zoological Record</i> cited below:&mdash;"At
night these spiders come out of their nests,
fasten the open trap-door to neighbouring objects,
and spin a net, about six inches long by scarcely half
an inch in height. In the morning the nets were
removed, and Erber believes that the net of each
night is added to the trap-door. He found eggs at
the bottom of the tubes, attached singly to threads, to
the number of about sixty. The young seem to form
dwellings very early."</p>

<p>It would be very interesting to know whether
these nocturnal habits are also found in our spiders
on the Riviera.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[ 116 ]</a></span></p>

<p>I have been favoured<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> with a sight of an unpublished
manuscript by Mr. Hansard giving an account
of his observations on <i>Cteniza fodiens</i>, made in Corfu.
This gentleman states that some of these spiders
which he kept in captivity, used to come out at night,
and might sometimes be surprised roaming about the
room at a very early hour in the morning. He, however,
relates that he had received from a friend an
account of a trap-door spider inhabiting the island of
Formosa, in the China seas, which constructed nests
similar to those of <i>Cteniza fodiens</i>, but which were
habitually to be seen outside their nests in the daytime,
attracting attention by "staring at" any one
who might approach, and then hurrying back to
their nests and closing their doors after them.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_76" id="Footnote_76"></a><a href="#FNanchor_76"><span class="label">[76]</span></a> I am indebted to Mr. Moseley for procuring this MS., and to Prof.
Rolleston, whose property it is, for permission to make use of it.</p></div>

<p>Lady Parker has also told me of some black trap-door
spiders which were so common about Paramatta,
near Sydney, in Australia, that scarcely any one paid
attention to them, and which might habitually be
seen out on the garden paths in the daytime near
their holes, to which they would run in all haste
when alarmed. The eye of the passer-by was attracted
by the open doors, which were about the size
of a sixpence, and fall over backwards when the spider
makes her exit, but when closed, on her return, they
fit so neatly that it is extremely difficult to detect
them.</p>

<p>It will, perhaps, have been observed that I have
throughout spoken of the female spider only, scarcely
any allusion having been made to the male. The
truth is that, though I have carefully searched for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[ 117 ]</a></span>
them, I have never been able to secure more than
a single male spider.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> During the winter, spring,
and late autumn (October) the female appears to live
solitary, in the daytime at least, and the male probably
hides in the crevices of old walls and in similar
places. I have diligently turned over piles of stone,
greatly to the annoyance of many little scorpions, but
have never secured, or even seen, another male spider.
This is the more to be regretted as the species of
trap-door spider are much better characterized in the
male than in the female sex, the bulb-like enlargement
which is found at the end of the palpi in the
former taking on a great variety of forms, each of
which is distinctive.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_77" id="Footnote_77"></a><a href="#FNanchor_77"><span class="label">[77]</span></a> Three days before sending this MS. to print, and long after the plates
had been completed, I captured on Oct. 23rd one male of <i>Nemesia Eleanora</i>.
He lay crouched in a crevice in a mossy bank, and had, perhaps, been driven
out of some deeper hiding-place by the heavy rains.</p></div>

<p>M. de Walckenaer<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> says:&mdash;"C'est toujours pendant
la nuit que ces aran&eacute;ides travaillent &agrave; leurs

<p>Any one, therefore, who has an opportunity of examining
the nests during the early autumn, might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[ 118 ]</a></span>
perhaps, discover the happy families spoken of by M.
Dorth&egrave;s, but which it has never been my good fortune
to see. It is not known positively whether the
male spider ever assists in the construction of the
nest, but, as we know that the female is able to make
it without his aid, there seems no reason to suppose
that he does.</p>

<p>I have seen the female <i>Nemesia meridionalis</i> construct
a trap-door in captivity, after having been placed on a
flower-pot full of earth in which I had made a cylindrical
hole.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> She quickly disappeared into this hole,
and, during the night following the day of her
capture, she made a thin web over the aperture, into
which she wove any materials which came to hand.
The trap-door at this stage resembled a rudely constructed,
horizontal, geometrical web, attached by two
or three threads to the earth at the mouth of the hole,
while in this web were caught the bits of earth, roots,
moss, leaves &amp;c. which the spider had thrown into it
from above. After the second night the door appeared
nearly of the normal texture and thickness, but in no
case would it open completely, and it seemed that the
spider was too much disgusted with her quarters to
think it worth while to make a perfect door. I believe
that when a door is finished the few threads which
served as supports and connected it with the earth on
either side of the hinge are severed, and this is borne
out by the following instance. While I was at work
one evening drawing the spider's nest concealed in the
plant of ceterach fern (<a href="#Plate_XI">Plate XI.</a>, fig. A, p. 105) which
I had dug out for the purpose, I detected something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[ 119 ]</a></span>
moving at the mouth of a tiny hole [just large enough
to admit a crowquill pen] in the mass of earth on the
opposite side of the fern, to that in which the large
trap-door lay.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_79" id="Footnote_79"></a><a href="#FNanchor_79"><span class="label">[79]</span></a> An account of further experiments with captive spiders will be found in
<a href="#Appendix_G2">Appendix G</a>.</p></div>

<p>The lamp-light fell full upon it, and I soon saw that
the moving object was a very small spider, not bigger
than that drawn at B 2 in <a href="#Plate_IX">Plate IX.</a>, which was at work
in the mouth of its tube. Whether I had, in removing this
mass of earth, destroyed the door I cannot say, but it
is certain that the opening of the tube was completely
uncovered, and it soon became apparent that the little
spider was intent upon remedying this deficiency.
After a few threads had been spun from side to side of
the tube I watched the spider make one or two hasty
sorties, apparently spinning all the while, and finally I
saw her gather up an armful, as it were, of earth and lay
this on the web. After this the occupant of the tube
was concealed, but I could see from the movement of
the particles of earth that they were being consolidated,
and that the weaving of the under surface of the door
was being completed. Next morning I was able to
lift up the door, which had the form of a small cup of
silk, in which the earth lay. It was then soft and
pliant, but in ten days time it had hardened and
become a very fair specimen of a minute cork door (see
figs. A 1, A 2, of <a href="#Plate_XI">Plate XI.</a>).</p>

<p>On one occasion a captive <i>Nemesia meridionalis</i>
employed some pieces of scarlet braid which I had
purposely strewed, along with bits of moss and fragments
of leaves, in a circle round the opening of, and
about two inches away from, the hole.</p>

<p>It is probable that these spiders have in times past
learned by experience that they cannot do better than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[ 120 ]</a></span>
take such materials as come to hand, as these will
ordinarily serve for the concealment of their door.</p>

<p>However, these trap-door spiders do seem to exercise
some discrimination in the choice of materials; for I
have observed several instances in which, when the
door of a cork nest has been removed, if the door was
originally covered with moss, moss will again be used
in its reconstruction, even though the mouth of the
tube be then surrounded by bare earth.</p>

<p>Thus, for example, in one case where I had cut out
a little clod of mossy earth, about two inches thick
and three square on the surface, containing the top of
the tube and the moss-covered cork door of <i>N. c&aelig;mentaria</i>,
I found, on revisiting the place six days later,
that a new door had been made, and that the spider
had mounted up to fetch moss from the undisturbed
bank above, planting it in the earth which formed
the crown of the door.<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Here the moss actually called
the eye to the trap, which lay in the little plain of
brown earth made by my digging.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_80" id="Footnote_80"></a><a href="#FNanchor_80"><span class="label">[80]</span></a> Mrs. Boyle first called my attention to this curious fact, of which I
have since seen many examples. I have purposely removed several cork
doors from mossy banks in order to observe this point.</p></div>

<p>I have seen the same thing happen when the door
of <i>N. Eleanora</i> has been removed and replaced, moss
being again used in the work of reconstruction. Trap-door
spiders in warm weather very quickly replace
their trap-doors; and if you pass by a wall where
several nests have been robbed of their doors only
a week before, they will usually be found quite perfect
again.</p>

<p>It has been stated<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> that, if the door of a cork nest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[ 121 ]</a></span>
be fastened down with a pin, a second door will be
found next day by the side of the former one. No
doubt spiders not unfrequently find their doors
blocked up by a fall of earth, and are thus obliged
either to make a new opening or to prolong the old
tube.</p>

Aranea, in Trans. Linn. Soc. (London), II. 88-90.</p></div>

<p>I once fastened open the surface doors of three of
the double-door nests by passing a thread through
the silk of the door and tying it back to some twigs
above. The doors were thus turned backwards, and
the aperture of the tubes, which lay in a vertical terrace
wall, exposed to view.</p>

<p>Next day, after a night of very heavy rain, I found
the doors as I had left them, but in one nest the
lip of the tube had been dragged inwards so as
partially to close the tube; in the second nothing
appeared to have been done, but in the third nest a
new covering had been very cleverly extemporized
out of three fallen olive-leaves, which were loosely
spun together and attached by one or two threads to
the margin of the tube. This formed an admirable
concealment, but did not move freely as a door, the
web being too imperfect. Two days later, however, it
was completed and had become a perfect door, moving
on a hinge just within and below that of the
former door, which still remained as I had fastened
it. The other nests remained in the same condition
as before, only that a little moss had been
dragged into the mouth of the tube of the nest,
which had been partially closed with its own lip.</p>

<p>The extreme reluctance which these spiders show
to abandon their dwellings is curiously exemplified
by what follows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[ 122 ]</a></span></p>

<p>Certain nests which were furnished with two doors
of the cork type were observed by Mr. S. S. Saunders<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
in the Ionian Islands. The door at the surface of
these nests was normal in position and structure, but
the lower one was placed at the very bottom of the
nest and inverted, so that, though apparently intended
to open downwards, it was permanently closed
by the surrounding earth. The presence of a carefully
constructed door in a situation which forbade
the possibility of its ever being opened seemed,
indeed, something difficult to account for. However,
it occurred to Mr. Saunders that, as these nests were
found in the cultivated ground round the roots of
olive-trees, they may occasionally have got turned
topsy-turvy when the soil was broken up. The
spider then, finding her door buried below in the
ground and the bottom of the tube at the surface,
would have either to seek new quarters or to adapt
the nest to its altered position, and make an opening
and door at the exposed end. In order to try
whether one of these spiders would do this Mr.
Saunders placed a nest, with its occupant inside, upside
down in a flower-pot. After the lapse of ten
days a new door was made, exactly as he had conjectured
it would be, and the nest presented two doors
like those which he had found at first.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_82" id="Footnote_82"></a><a href="#FNanchor_82"><span class="label">[82]</span></a> Description of a species of Mygale from Ionia in Trans. of Ent. Soc.
(London, 1839), III. p. 160.</p></div>

<p>There is a specimen of one of these inverted nests,
with its two doors, in the British Museum, and this
might easily be supposed, at first sight, to be an
example of a new kind of double-door nest. On close
inspection, however, it will be seen that one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[ 123 ]</a></span>
two doors is discoloured and partly decayed, this
being, no doubt, the one which had been buried beneath
in the earth and so rendered useless.</p>

<p>Questions have often been asked as to the manner
in which trap-door nests are commenced in the first
instance, and whether the weaving of the silk lining
is begun at the top or the bottom of the tube.</p>

<p>The structure of the cork door also, which often
appears so perfectly turned as to resemble the work
of a potter's lathe, is another difficulty.</p>

<p>These questions have, as it seems to me, been
needlessly complicated by taking it for granted that
the perfect nest of the mature spider is made all at
one time, that the tube, perhaps of a foot in length,
is excavated, lined, and furnished with a door within
some short period of time, such as ten days or a
fortnight, perhaps.</p>

<p>On the contrary, I believe that the nests are, as a
rule, the result of many successive enlargements, and
that the nest of the infant, the tube of which is no
bigger than a crowquill, is not abandoned, but becomes
that of the full-grown spider. This must
require time, but how long, whether months or years,
we have yet to learn.</p>

<p>Very little is known at present as to the longevity
of spiders, but Mr. Blackwall<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> says that some live
only one year, while others, such as <i>Tegenaria civilis</i>
and <i>Segestria senoculata</i>, have been known to live four.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_83" id="Footnote_83"></a><a href="#FNanchor_83"><span class="label">[83]</span></a> Spiders of Great Britain and Ireland, p. 8.</p></div>

<p>Whether the trap-door spiders are very long lived
or not I cannot positively say, but, from the appearance
of the growth of moss and lichen on the doors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[ 124 ]</a></span>
of some nests which I have observed, I am inclined
to think that they must have been inhabited for
more than a twelvemonth.</p>

<p>Evidence of the enlargement of the door is not
very rare to meet with, though, as a rule, the new
piece is woven on to the old with such neatness as
more or less to obscure this. In fig. B, <a href="#Plate_X">Plate X.</a>, p. 100,
the old and smaller surface-door of a nest of <i>Nemesia
meridionalis</i> is seen partially attached to the larger
new door, which has been constructed below it; while
in fig. C of the same plate, three doors, or rather three
enlargements of one door, may be traced. It is this,
I believe, that gives rise to the tiled appearance
which these trap-doors sometimes present, and which
has caused them to be compared to oyster-shells.
Something similar may also be occasionally seen in
doors of the cork type, as, for example, in that figured
at A and A 1 in <a href="#Plate_VIII">Plate VIII.</a>, p. 94, where the old and
smaller door is seen partially raised above the surface
of the new one. This I imagine to be merely an
example of rather clumsy workmanship, as, if I am
right, a full-sized cork door usually incloses within
itself several lesser doors, which formerly fitted the
tube and have had to be enlarged.</p>

<p>This is borne out by the fact that such a door will,
on examination, be found to consist of several layers of
silk, with more or less earth between each, these layers
decreasing in size from without inwards, and together
forming a sort of saucer in which the small central mass
of earth lies. Thus by moistening a series of the cork
doors of <i>Nemesia c&aelig;mentaria</i>, I have been able to detach,
in one of medium size, from six to fourteen circular
patches of silk, of which the outermost, or that which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[ 125 ]</a></span>
forms the lower surface of the door, is the largest, and
the innermost the smallest, the others being intermediate
in size as in position. Perhaps if I had had
larger doors at my disposal for examination I might
have found more layers, as other authors<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> speak of a
much greater number of layers in the cork doors of
<i>Cteniza fodiens</i>. Be this as it may, I am confirmed in
my opinion that the layers of silk mark the successive
enlargements of the nest by the additional fact
that in very small doors the layers of silk are few or
single, and that a proportion is observable as a rule
between the size of the door and the number of layers
of which it is composed.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_84" id="Footnote_84"></a><a href="#FNanchor_84"><span class="label">[84]</span></a> M. de Walckenaer seems to have found more than thirty alternate layers
of silk and earth in one of the doors of <i>Cteniza fodiens</i>, as we may gather
from the following:&mdash;"Quoique cette porte n'ait gu&egrave;re que trois lignes
d'epaisseur, elle est form&eacute;e par la superposition de plus de trente couches de
terre s&eacute;par&eacute;es les unes des autres par autant de couches de toile. Toutes
ces assises successives s'emboitent les unes dans les autres comme les poids
de cuivre &agrave; l'usage de nos petites balances. Les couches de toile se terminent
au pourtour de la porte." Walckenaer, Histoire des Insectes Apt&egrave;res
(Suites &agrave; Buffon), vol. i. p. 238 (Paris, 1837).
</p>
<p>
I have not found the regular layers of earth and silk of which M. de
Walckenaer speaks, the silk layers being usually in contact at their centres
and only separated by a little ring of earth interposed between their edges,
this earth being thickest towards the circumference of the layers of silk.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_85" id="Footnote_85"></a><a href="#FNanchor_85"><span class="label">[85]</span></a> This may be seen by the comparison of the composition of doors of
different sizes, given in <a href="#Appendix_H2">Appendix H</a>.</p></div>

<p>Another proof that enlargement takes place, may at
times be found in the nests of <i>N. Eleanora</i>, where one,
or even two useless doors may be detected behind the
lower door.</p>

<p>Now when there are three lower doors in this way
the one which is in use is the largest, and the door lying
nearest to this one the next in size, while the hindmost
is the smallest of all. But though those abandoned
doors are now too small to fit the existing tube, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[ 126 ]</a></span>
did so, no doubt, in their day, for they are exact copies
in miniature of the ordinary horse-shoe shaped lower
doors. The lower door actually in use may sometimes
be found to have two separable cases of thick silk
enclosing the central mass of earth, and this also, very
probably, represents enlargement. In the nests of <i>N.
meridionalis</i> I have never found any of these abandoned
doors behind the one in use, nor should I expect
to find any, for if they were present they would
permanently obstruct the entrance from the main tube
to the branch.</p>

<p>It is clear that it is better economy on the part of
the spider to enlarge its nest rather than build a new
one each time. If we compare the infant spider and its
nest (fig. B, <a href="#Plate_IX">Plate IX.</a>, p. 98) with the full-grown
creature and its nest (fig. A, <a href="#Plate_IX">Plate IX.</a>), it becomes
evident that the growing spider must either construct
many nests of intermediate size, or frequently enlarge
the original domicile. And we do in fact find nests
of all sizes between the two extremes.</p>

<p>I cannot help thinking that these very small nests,
built as they are by minute spiders probably not very
long hatched from the egg, must rank among the most
marvellous structures of the kind with which we are
acquainted. That so young and weak a creature should
be able to excavate a tube in the earth many times its
own length, and know how to make a perfect miniature
of the nest of its parents, seems to be a fact which has
scarcely a parallel in nature.</p>

<p>When we remember how difficult a thing it is for
even a trained draughtsman to reduce by eye a complicated
drawing or model to a greatly diminished
scale, we must own that the performance of this feat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[ 127 ]</a></span>
by a baby spider is so surprising as almost to exceed
belief.</p>

<p>And yet even the most complicated form of nest&mdash;namely,
that of the branched double-door type&mdash;is
perfectly reproduced in miniature by these tiny
architects, with the upper door, lower door, main
tube, and branch (fig. B, <a href="#Plate_IX">Plate IX.</a>, p. 98).</p>

<p>In order to test whether the doors are enlarged or
not I measured the surface doors of seven double-door
nests and one minute cork door on April 30th, making
a careful plan of the terrace wall in which they lay, in
order to make sure of finding them again on my return
to Mentone in October.</p>

<p>We can scarcely venture from such limited premises
to draw any precise conclusions, but if we suppose
that during the entire course of the year the nests
increase on an average by about four lines in
diameter, and assume that the rate of growth continue
the same, the nest of the infant spider, whose surface
door measures scarcely a line across, would still
require four years to attain the dimensions of some
of the largest double-door nests, whose surface doors
measure sixteen lines across.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[ 128 ]</a></span></p>

<p>It seems to be the rule with spiders generally that
the offspring should leave the nest and construct
dwellings for themselves when very young.</p>

<p>Mr. Blackwall,<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> speaking of British spiders, says:&mdash;"Complicated
as the processes are by which these
symmetrical nets are produced, nevertheless young
spiders, acting under the influence of instinctive impulse,
display, even in their first attempts to fabricate
them, as consummate skill as the most experienced
individuals."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_86" id="Footnote_86"></a><a href="#FNanchor_86"><span class="label">[86]</span></a> Loc. cit., <a href="#Page_11">p. 11</a>.</p></div>

<p>Again, Mr. F. Pollock<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> relates of the young of
<i>Epeira aurelia</i>, which he observed in Madeira, that
when seven weeks old they made a web the size of
a penny, and that these nets have the same beautiful
symmetry as those of the full-grown spider. Those
of the latter are vertical, circular, made of about 250
feet of thread, having about 35 radial lines and 38
concentric circles, the outermost of which is some 20
inches in diameter. After the lapse of a day or two
the web loses its adhesive property and a new one is
made. In about six months the female <i>Epeira</i> has
completed her ten changes of skin, one of which takes
place in the cocoon, and "at the end of eight months
the spider is 2700 times as heavy as at its birth."
This <i>Epeira</i> lives, we are told, for about eighteen months.</p>

<p>One can scarcely contemplate the work of these
architects and weavers, and especially of the trap-door
makers, without being carried away into the whirlpool
of discussion which has so long raged round the word
<i>instinct</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[ 129 ]</a></span></p>

<p>Do the young spiders build their first nest by instinct&mdash;that
is to say, independently of all teaching or
personal experience&mdash;or do they copy the nests in
which they were hatched?</p>

<p>What is wanting, however, is not discussion, of
which we have had enough, but demonstration, and
demonstration is hard to come by, depending as it
must upon careful and repeated experiment.</p>

<p>If it were practicable, and I have no reason to know
that it is not, to rear spiders from the egg away from
the nest, and then to cause them to build in places
where they should be perfectly at home and yet cut
off from all communication with their kind, we might
hope to learn whether they can construct the characteristic
nests of their species without ever having
seen one.</p>

<p>Mr. Wallace<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> shows that there is some reason to
doubt whether birds, which are so frequently said to
build by instinct, would, under parallel circumstances,
construct the nest proper to their kind; and he states
that birds brought up from the egg in cages do not
do so, nor do they even sing their parents' song without
being taught.</p>

to the Theory of Natural Selection.</p></div>

<p>Of course we can scarcely compare birds and spiders
together, but we should hesitate, in view of Mr.
Wallace's expressed opinion as to the nest-building
habits of the former, to assume that the latter are
independent of teaching and personal experience. It
may very possibly be so, but it has never been proved.</p>

<p>I have endeavoured to gather together all the published
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[ 130 ]</a></span>
records of the nests of spiders belonging to the
sub-order <i>Territelari&aelig;</i>, with a view, if possible, to trace
out the geographical range of the several types of
structure. I have, however, met with but a small
amount of success, and even among the limited number
of tolerably complete accounts of nests which I have
been able to discover, several made no mention of the
spider to which the nest belongs.</p>

<p>Prof. Ausserer<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> has enumerated 215 species of
<i>Territelari&aelig;</i> as having been found in the world at
large, but of this large number ten only, as far as I
have been able to learn, have been described in connexion
with their nests, and eight of these belong to
the Mediterranean region.<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> To these we may now
add two more, namely, <i>Nemesia meridionalis</i>, with its
branched double-door nest, and <i>N. Eleanora</i> the builder
of the unbranched double-door nest, thus making
twelve in all.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_89" id="Footnote_89"></a><a href="#FNanchor_89"><span class="label">[89]</span></a> In his monograph of <i>Territelari&aelig;</i> quoted above.</p></div>

<p>Three of the twelve, however, <i>Atypus piceus</i>, <i>A.
Blackwallii</i>, and <i>Nemesia cellicola</i>,<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> do not appear to
build true trap-doors, but only a simple silk tube
without any covering at the mouth.</p>

species. For, while the single-door wafer, and the
branched and unbranched double-door nests are each
the work of one particular spider, we see that nests
of the cork type are made by spiders of six distinct
species, belonging to at least three genera.</p>

<p>It is almost certain that a much larger number of
spiders of different kinds, though all probably members
of the sub-order <i>Territelari&aelig;</i>, construct nests of the
cork type, for descriptions and specimens of trap-doors
of this kind are brought from the most distant
parts of the globe. It is true that these specimens
and descriptions usually only show us the surface-door,
but as far as our present knowledge goes, we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[ 132 ]</a></span>
are led to suppose that a door of the cork type is
always associated with a simple tube, in which there
is no trace of a second door or valve, so that, judging
of the unknown by the known, we conclude that
nests which possess the characteristic peculiarity of
a true cork door are true cork nests in other respects
also. Further research may possibly show that there
are exceptions to this generalization, but I do not
at present know of any.</p>

<p>I have seen Australian specimens of large trap-doors,
of the cork type, measuring from one to two
inches across. In some of these the doors were scarcely
more than semicircular but very thick, and having
their edges bevelled so as to correspond with the
sloping margin of the tube;<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> in others, found at
Paramatta, and described to me by Lady Parker
as being tenanted by a black spider, the doors were
said to be circular and much smaller, scarcely larger
than a sixpence, and of the cork type.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_92" id="Footnote_92"></a><a href="#FNanchor_92"><span class="label">[92]</span></a> Specimens of Australian nests may be seen in the cases at the British
Museum.</p></div>

<p>The upper portion of a nest from New Granada has
been figured and described by M. Victor Audouin,<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
which closely resembles that drawn at Fig. A in <a href="#Plate_VII">Plate VII.</a>,
p. 88, but the door is about a third larger.</p>

Annales des Sciences Naturelles (Zoologie), tom. vii. tab. 3, p. 227-231.</p></div>

<p>I have also been assured that nests of the cork
type are found in many parts of India, and we have
seen above that they are reported to be common in
the island of Formosa.</p>

<p>Putting all this together, it will be seen that nests
of this type are found all round the globe; in Formosa,
India, Syria, the Grecian Archipelago, Italy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[ 133 ]</a></span>
and the adjacent islands, Trieste, South France, Spain,
Morocco, New Granada, and Australia; while the
single-door wafer nest is only known at present in
the West India islands;<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> the branched double-door
nest at Mentone, Cannes, and Pegli near Genoa, and
[doubtfully] near Naples and in Ischia; and the unbranched
double-door type at Mentone and Cannes
alone. It is quite probable that these three latter
forms of nest will some day be found to have a much
wider range than that assigned to them here, but I
can scarcely think it likely that they will ever be
shown to claim the world-wide distribution of the
cork type. Supposing that these nests are eventually
discovered in many widely distant localities, a very
interesting question will arise as to the specific characters
of the spiders which inhabit and construct
them. Shall we then find, for example, that nests of
the unbranched double-door type are not tenanted
and fabricated by <i>Nemesia Eleanora</i> alone, as we
have hitherto found to be the case, but by many
other distinct species also, each in its peculiar
district?</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_94" id="Footnote_94"></a><a href="#FNanchor_94"><span class="label">[94]</span></a> There is a nest exhibited in the Museum collection at the Jardin des
Plantes at Paris, marked "Am&eacute;rique du Sud," which is perhaps of this type.</p></div>

<p>That is to say, will the type of nest remain the
same while the occupants vary, as in the cork
nests?</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, we learn that these three
types, the single-door wafer, the branched and unbranched
double-door nests, are very local, we shall
be led to inquire into the probable causes of this
limitation.</p>

<p>But we must study much more closely the habits of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[ 134 ]</a></span>
these trap-door spiders, and the difficulties and dangers
to which they are exposed, if we wish to appreciate
fully the true meaning and intention of the structure
of their nests, and to find the clue to the difficult
question why one type should be more frequently
adopted than another. Above all, we must discover
what are their enemies, and how and when they are
most exposed to them. M. de Walckenaer gives an
entertaining account<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> of the enemies to which spiders
generally are exposed, and of this the following list is
an abstract.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_95" id="Footnote_95"></a><a href="#FNanchor_95"><span class="label">[95]</span></a> Histoire des Insectes Apt&egrave;res (Suites &agrave; Buffon), vol. i. p. 172-7.</p></div>

<p>Many kinds of monkeys, squirrels, and several sorts
of birds, as well as lizards, tortoises, frogs, and toads
prey upon spiders. A species of black sheep, found in
the steppes of Asiatic Russia, unearths the tarantulas
(Lycosa), and eats them. ("Une esp&egrave;ce de brebis noire,
dans les steppes de la Russie asiatique, d&eacute;terre les
tarentules et les mange"). In the East India Archipelago
there is an entire genus of birds of the passerine
order, which have been named "Arachnopt&egrave;res"
because the different species of which it is composed
live exclusively on spiders. Besides these, the centipede
(<i>Scolopendra</i>), and the following Hymenopterous
insects, <i>Philanthes</i>, <i>Sphex</i>, <i>Pompilus</i>, <i>Pimpla Ovivora</i>,
and <i>P. Arachnitor</i> [which last lay their eggs in the
eggs of spiders], carry on perpetual hostilities against
them.</p>

<p>I have seen it stated that ants are among the worst
enemies of spiders, driving their galleries through the
silk tubes of the latter and devouring their eggs. Of
this I have never seen any trace, and, on the contrary,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[ 135 ]</a></span>
have on four occasions found the remains of ants'
bodies at the bottom of the trap-door spiders'
nests.</p>

<p>I have but seldom detected any refuse in these nests,
and this accords with what M. Erber tells us<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> of the
care with which <i>Cteniza Ariana</i>, which he watched by
moonlight in the island of Tinos, carried away the
empty bodies of the beetles, the juices of which had
been sucked out, to a distance of some feet from its
hole. In October, 1872, however, I found a black
layer of d&eacute;bris at the bottom of five nests of <i>Nemesia
Eleanora</i>, and this was composed principally of
the remains of insects, and among others of some
rather large beetles.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_96" id="Footnote_96"></a><a href="#FNanchor_96"><span class="label">[96]</span></a> A translation of these very interesting observations will be found below
in <a href="#Appendix_B2">Appendix B</a>.</p></div>

<p>As far as I am aware, M. Erber is the only naturalist
who has ever placed any detailed observations on
record as to the nocturnal habits of a trap-door spider
in its native haunts; and we may learn from him
how we should watch these creatures, if we wish to
discover the manner in which they take their prey,
and of what their prey consists.</p>

<p>He relates how he witnessed the capture, in the
long low snare which <i>Cteniza Ariana</i> spreads close to
the ground, of two strong, night-flying beetles (<i>Pimelia</i>
and <i>Cephalostenus</i>), and how these were at once devoured,
and their horny coats thrown away.</p>

<p>More observations of this kind are greatly wanted,
as it is most important that we should know what are
the principal sources of food upon which these spiders
depend for their existence.</p>

<p>If we could answer the questions, what do they eat?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[ 136 ]</a></span>
and what do they fear? we should have advanced a
long way towards resolving the larger problem as to
the causes which limit particular species to certain
districts.</p>

<p>I greatly envy those who are able to travel, and
who have it in their power to investigate the habits
of these creatures at several widely separated points;
for there seems every probability that other new types
of nest remain to be detected in warm climates, some
of which may perhaps exceed those we have been
here studying in beauty of workmanship and adaptation;
it is at least certain that an abundant harvest of
interesting facts in the life history of trap-door spiders
remains yet to be gathered in.</p>

<p>Indeed it appears to me that we are only on the
threshold of discoveries of this kind, and that the
materials brought together in the preceding pages
may be considered as but a small sample of what may
be collected on the outermost edge of this great
domain.</p>

<p>I shall be satisfied if I have been able in the present
little work, to hold the door sufficiently ajar to permit
those who love nature and her ways to catch a glimpse
of the wonders and beauties of the untrodden land
that lies beyond.</p>

radiatim, abdomine seriatim dispositis, subtus thorace rufescente,
abdomine flavidulo, mandibulis spinarum serie unica,
tarsis omnibus spinulosis."</p>

<p>"The cephalothorax oval, elongated and truncate in front,
while the head is smooth and bare, with a group of eight
eyes, a little keeled in the middle; of a fulvous-brown colour,
with ten rather dusky spots arranged in rays, and corresponding
to the direction of the eight legs (anche) and the two
maxill&aelig;. The mandibles are large, horizontal at first, then
curved downwards, making a quarter of a circle, furnished
with numerous hairs, especially on the inner side, and at the
anterior extremity above there are mobile and rather long
spines; below they are channelled, with six little teeth or
spines on the edge (rilievo) of the inner face, clothed with
many bristling hairs, with which the outside is also covered,
but without any teeth; on the inner face they are flattened,
so that they fit perfectly close. The fang is strong,
curved, acute, and black. The maxill&aelig; are clothed with
brown hairs almost as the legs are, and at their extremity, on
the outer side, stand the long palpi, rather hairy (pelacciuti),
terminated by a very short and simple little claw. The sternal
lip is very small and round. The abdomen oval, longer
or shorter according to age, dusky ash in colour, spotted with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[ 138 ]</a></span>
brown, and covered with short and depressed (rasicci)
hairs. The brown spots are disposed in slanting lines, placed
obliquely to the median line, which is also brown; below it is
somewhat lighter, and becomes slightly yellow, increasingly
so in the female as pregnancy advances. The pulmonal sacs
are always pale yellow, and involved in the fold (tramezzati
dalla ripiegatura). Between these, and within the fold itself,
the female sexual organ opens, consisting of a transverse
opening invisible to the naked eye, but clearly seen on using
a lens and removing the fold under which it is concealed, by
means of the point of a scalpel or of a pin. The posterior
extremity of the anus presents four spinnerets, of which the
two upper are much the longer, and composed of four easily
seen joints, the lower very short. The feet are moderate,
and the longest are of the length of the entire body when
this is fully developed (quando &egrave; perfettamente sviluppato);
of these the fourth pair are about a third longer than the
first, the third of about the same length as the second, which
is the shortest of all. The tarsi of these are armed with two
small curved claws, and the third and fourth joint with many
long, delicate, straight, and mobile spines, which in the first
pair become fewer as they approach the last joint. The eyes
are arranged in three lines, as they are represented in C,
<a href="#Plate_I">Plate I.</a>, Fig. 3, and of these the two last of the posterior line
are white and glistening, the others brown.</p>

<p>"Our <i>Mygale</i> lives in tubular cavities, or burrows, which she
excavates for herself in loose and friable soil, in walls made of
volcanic earth, in shady places, and for the most part turned
to the north or to the west, seldom to the south&mdash;hence cool
and rather damp. The burrows do not exceed the length of
a palm, eight lines at their widest part. For about the
length of an inch the tube is funnel shaped, thence it continues
of a nearly uniform magnitude. Its first direction is
almost horizontal, then it rises continually, turning to the
right or left, and sometimes makes zigzags. As the tubes
are excavated in friable soil, she takes care to tapestry them
inside with the same glutinous material of which the other
races make their web, by means of which the burrows are
made smooth on the inside, and to strengthen them in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[ 139 ]</a></span>
such a manner that even when the outer earthy part has
become cracked, or been torn away by the action of the rain,
they remain firm and fit to conceal their inhabitant. I have
often found the tubes of web thus left exposed, as they are
represented in <a href="#Plate_I">Plate I.</a>, Fig. 4, situated in the cement of a
wall, and among <i>Lycopodium denticulatum</i>, <i>Adiantum
Capillus-Veneris</i>, <i>Marchantia polymorpha</i>, and other small
plants. And it seems that the animal, perceiving the nature
of the soil, takes care to reinforce the silken case, so much
the more as she finds the earth less firm, and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. So
that in burrows excavated in solid ground, with the exception
of a little space close to the aperture, the nest is merely
smoothed and daubed; while sometimes the spider constructs
a tube so strong that it supports itself even when deprived of
all the earth, the animal having had the foresight to attach
it along the course of the clefts of the rock, or to the cement
of the pieces of tufa in the wall, as represented in <a href="#Plate_I">Plate I.</a>
They have often also a double aperture, and the upper portions
of the burrows converging, meet and anastomose at about
two inches distance. The aperture is closed by a little door or
valve (<i>a</i>), which, having its hinge in the upper part and a little
on one side, falls by its own weight, and fits itself exactly to the
opening. The outer surface of the wicket is covered with
earth, cemented by the glue of the spider, so that it is rendered
imperceptible to common eyes, and the industrious
little creature takes care to leave around the aperture a kind
of rim, to which the door fitting closely, leaves no passage for
any animal, nor does it show its edges. At the bottom of its
tube the creature keeps her numerous offspring, and always
stands herself as sentinel at the door, holding the wicket
raised by means of the four anterior feet, and the palpi, curved
extremities of which she inserts between the rim of the tube
and of the door, as represented in <i>a' f</i>. Sometimes, however,
they do not appear, but she leaves only the chink for observation,
as one sees in <i>a</i> of the same figure. Fig. 2, at <i>c</i>, represents
the aperture of an abandoned burrow, and at <i>d</i> the
raised door of another burrow, with its almost funnel-shaped
aperture. That which Sauvage, Olivier, and Latreille relate
of her is not true&mdash;namely, that she remains at the bottom of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[ 140 ]</a></span>
the burrow, and runs to the door only when she sees it
threatened, in order to keep the door firmly closed. On the
contrary, always standing at the door as sentinel, she leaves
it as soon as she thinks it in danger, so that it can be raised
without the least effort: but if you hold it a little raised
without making any sign of movement, she turns on her
back, and comes out to draw it down with her feet, making
all the efforts she can to conquer the obstacle. But if
you take it away entirely, she turns down the edges to
close the aperture as best she can, and that she does hurriedly,
without waiting for night. The light seems to offend her
so much that, if exposed to the full day, she remains so
stupefied as to appear dead, nor does she move even if
shaken; on the contrary, she constantly stops still and
holds herself with her feet pressed against her body. At
last, if very much disturbed, she runs quickly for some
distance, till she finds a place in which to hide her head, and
from thence she does not stir. I have observed that the burrows
are always short when the aperture is small, and increase
in length as they augment in diameter, which makes
me conclude that it is not true that they begin their excavations
from the base of the mother's tube, where I have never
found any communication with others. This spider is found
in the neighbourhood of Naples (ne' contorni della Capitale),
on the Camaldoli, in the island of Ischia, where it lives near
the sources of mineral waters, in Gaeta at the foot of the
olive trees, among the stones in the ground, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>"Observation. The difference which distinguishes our <i>Mygale</i>
from the <i>Sauvagesii</i> consists, first, in the toothing of the
mandibles, which is observable on one side only of the channel,
and not on both; secondly, in the tarsi all equally armed
with spines, and not only the four anterior ones; thirdly, in
the colour of the thorax and the abdomen, which is not
uniform as is usual in the <i>Sauvagesii</i>. Nevertheless, such
differences might be in part climatic, which would cause our
<i>Mygale</i> to be considered as a mere variety of the same
species, and the others might be the result of the different
method of examining the parts, and of the goodness of the
instruments."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[ 141 ]</a></span></p>

<p>At p. 19, in the <i>Fauna del Regno di Napoli</i>, M. Costa
gives the following account of the nest of <i>Nemesia cellicola</i>,
which he discovered above San Martino in September,
1833:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Vive entro la polvere arida, nelle cavit&agrave; oscure delle
muraglie, e propriamente nelle così dette <i>Saettiere</i>, ove, col
glutine suo, si costruisce un tubo delicato e mobile, che ha cura
di affidare nel suo origine a qualche corpo stabile nel fondo del
muro, e che in terra nella polvere, aprendosi l'altro estremo
sul piano inclinato dalla polvere stessa costituto."</p>

<p>This, with the exception of the words "e che in terra nella
polvere," which are unintelligible to me as they stand, and
appear to want a verb, may be translated as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"She lives in the dry dust, in the obscure crevices of walls,
and especially in those which are called <i>Saettiere</i> (loop-holed
walls?), where she constructs a delicate and flexible tube with
her viscid secretion, and which she takes care to fasten at its
commencement to some solid body at the bottom of the wall,
... the other extremity opening on the inclined plane
formed by the dust itself."</p>

<p>We may remark that there is here no mention of any door
or concealment at the mouth of the tube, and in this and
some other respects the nest of <i>Nemesia cellicola</i> would
appear to resemble the nest of <i>Atypus piceus</i> from the neighbourhood
of Paris. See above in the text, <a href="#Page_78">p. 78</a>.</p>

M. Erber before the Botanico Zoological Association of Vienna,<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>

Ariana</i> when travelling in the Grecian Archipelago.</p>

<p>"On my return voyage [from Rhodes], I stayed for a fortnight
in the island of Tinos, and, among other things, I captured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[ 142 ]</a></span>
several specimens of the so-called trap-door spider
(Deckelspinne) <i>Cteniza Ariana</i>, Walck., and with much trouble
procured an entire tube and trap-door of this creature....
I am thus enabled to exhibit to this honourable assembly the
complete nest of this creature, and the spider herself, with her
eggs, preserved in alcohol, and can moreover add some few
words as to her habits.</p>

<p>"It needs some practice, as the specimen before you shows,
to enable one to discover the nest, as the door is always closed
by day. I dug out several of these tubes, but failed to find
either the remains of food or excrement. So there was nothing
for it but to devote a couple of nights to watch these creatures.
With this view I selected a place where many spiders had
excavated their tunnels, and availed myself of a moonlight
night for my observations.</p>

<p>"Shortly after nine o'clock the doors opened and the spiders
came out, fastened back the trap-doors by means of threads
to neighbouring blades of grass or little stones, then spun a
snare about six inches long by half an inch high, and afterwards
returned quietly to their holes.</p>

<p>"I had so chosen my position that I could see three of these
spiders at the same time. I now captured a specimen and put
it into spirits, and in a short time saw entangled in the net of
one of the remaining spiders a <i>Pimelia</i>, and of the other a
<i>Cephalostenus</i>, both rather hard-lived, night-flying beetles,
which were seized by the spiders, and the latter, after sucking
out the juices, carried the empty bodies to a distance of
several feet from their holes. All these events happened in
about three hours, after which time I allowed the two spiders
to remain undisturbed, and returned to the house.</p>

<p>"Early next morning I revisited the spot, and then perceived
that these two spiders had entirely removed the net which they
made the preceding night, but the entrance to the nest of the
spider which I had captured still remained open, and I could
clearly trace the shape of its snare, on which the heavy
morning's dew lay. The upper threads were isolated, but the
snare became thicker as it approached the ground. I found
that these snares had, strange to relate, been gathered up by
the two other spiders, fastened on to the door, and smoothly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[ 143 ]</a></span>
spun over, and, on making a vertical section of the doors, which
were nearly a quarter of an inch thick, I discovered that they
were composed of several layers.</p>

<p>"In the nests of several females I found eggs at the bottom
of the tube, not placed in cocoons, but attached by separate
threads. The young spiders when hatched are turned out
from the asylum of their mother's nest; and I found these
creatures when scarcely two lines long already established in
nests three inches deep, and furnished with perfect trap-doors,
of which facts the specimens I now lay before you are the
evidence."</p>

<p class="caption4nb"><i>Hints on Collecting Spiders.</i></p>

<p>It is very important to collect adult specimens of males
and females, but the former, from their roaming habits, are
often extremely difficult to find.</p>

<p>At night they may sometimes be taken by lamp-light near
the nests of the females, and certain kinds are said to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[ 145 ]</a></span>
live with the female during the months of September and
October. The females may usually be found in their nests
during the daytime (always in Europe?).</p>

<p>Large spiders should be killed, or at least stupefied with
chloroform, before being put into spirit of wine. It is convenient
to place the specimens in glass test-tubes closed with
corks, and filled with pure spirit of wine, as they may then
be examined through the glass.</p>

<p>When specimens of more than one species are placed in
the same tube or bottle, it is well to distinguish each by a
number written in pencil on a small strip of card fastened
round the body with a slip-noose of thread.</p>

<p>The patterns on the abdomen and cephalothorax of the
spiders are seen very distinctly when the spiders are immersed
in spirits of wine, and these frequently afford characters which
aid in determining the species.</p>

<p>M. Thorell, in the introduction to his work <i>On European
Spiders</i>,<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> gives a detailed account of a method by which
specimens may be prepared for mounting in cabinets, by drying
them within a glass tube held over a flame, but it would
appear that, for purposes of study, specimens preserved in
spirit of wine are far preferable.</p>

Upsaliensis, ser. 3, vol. viii. fasc. I. et II. (Upsala, 1871).</p></div>

<p>It is very desirable to obtain characteristic portions of, or if
possible entire nests, but where the tubes are long, this is
extremely difficult to do satisfactorily.</p>

<p>Some nests, preserved in the British Museum, have been
coated with thin glue, and this appears to be of some use in
binding the parts together. I find that by stuffing the tube
full of cotton-wool, before attempting to remove the earth,
the nest may sometimes be obtained in tolerably good condition.</p>

<p class="caption4nb"><i>The Nest of the Tarantula (Lycosa Tarentula).</i></p>

<p>As it is of some interest to compare the burrow of the
Tarantula with the nest of its near allies the trap-door spiders,
I give the following <i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> of M. Dufour's observations:<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_101" id="Footnote_101"></a><a href="#FNanchor_101"><span class="label">[101]</span></a> Quoted by M. Lucas, in his Histoire Nat. des Animaux Crustac&eacute;s et
Arachnides, p. 357.</p></div>

<p>"<i>Lycosa Tarentula</i> forms a cylindrical burrow in the earth,
often more than a foot long, and about one inch in diameter.
At about four or five inches below the surface the perpendicular
tube is bent horizontally, and it is at this angle that
the Tarantula watches for the approach of enemies or prey.</p>

<p>"The external orifice of the burrow of the Tarantula is
ordinarily surmounted by a separately constructed tube, and
which authors have not hitherto mentioned; this tube, a true
piece of architecture, rises to about an inch above the surface
of the ground, and is sometimes as much as two inches in diameter,
being thus larger than the burrow itself. This tube
is principally composed of fragments of wood fastened
together with clayey earth, and so artistically disposed one
above the other that they form a scaffolding having the shape
of an upright column, of which the interior is a hollow
cylinder."</p>

<p>M. Dufour observes, however, that the exterior tube was
not found in all the nests. In every case the tube was lined
with silk throughout its whole length.</p>

<p>&#9794; Passing over the precise description of this pretty species
by its author, Herr Dr. L. Koch, let us note here some of the
essential characters which distinguish this species from its
relations. <i>Cephalothorax</i> fairly (sch&ouml;n) rounded, with small,
moderately prominent head. Eye eminence (Augenh&uuml;gel)
prominent, steeply inclined in front and behind. The front
and rear row of eyes form two nearly parallel curves with the
concavity in front. The foremost central eyes stand so high
that a line (eine Gerade) drawn from their base to the lateral
eyes would pass just above them, although they are not
separated from the lateral eyes by a distance greater than
that of their own radius. Eyes of front row almost twice as
large as those of hind row. Teeth of rake (Rechens) long and
sharp. <i>Palpi</i> moderately long, the last and penultimate
joint armed as in <i>N. cellicola</i>.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> Bulb pear-shaped, with a
rather shorter, more slender point. All the tarsi of the legs,
and even the metatarsi I and II, with a slender scopula,
although the tarsi are unarmed. Tibia I enlarged into a
wedge-shape, (having) beneath the apex a stout pointed tooth
bent upwards and inwards, in front of which (is) a truncated
prominence (ein oben gerade abgestutzter H&ouml;cker). Femur
(Schenkel) (having) dusky longitudinal stripes above within.&mdash;Cephalothorax
6&middot;5<sup>mm</sup>.</p>

<p class="caption4nb"><i>On Nemesia meridionalis and N. Eleanora, Captive
in Company with their Young.</i></p>

<p>I have tried the experiment of keeping specimens of
<i>Nemesia meridionalis</i> and <i>N. Eleanora</i> captive in flower-pots,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[ 149 ]</a></span>
partly filled with earth and covered with gauze, but I
have never been able to detect the least inclination on the
part of either of these spiders to excavate a burrow in the
earth.</p>

<p>Thinking that I might have better success if I were to
place the mother spiders, together with their young, in
captivity, I captured a female <i>N. meridionalis</i> and <i>N.
Eleanora</i>, each with its brood, and placed them on moist
earth in flower-pots under gauze. The result, however, was
that the young spiders concealed themselves in the crevices
of the soil, while the mother spiders remained exposed.</p>

<p>The adult <i>N. meridionalis</i> lived thus for twenty days
(from the 7th to the 27th of November), capturing and
killing flies with which I supplied her, but she then suddenly
died.</p>

<p>After seventeen days' captivity the other species (<i>N.
Eleanora</i>) began to cover a small surface of the gauze with
a semi-transparent substance (which resembled varnish rather
than silk), secreted from its spinners, and four days later it
began to weave a cell; this cell took twelve days to complete,
and finally assumed the shape of a rudely-formed figure of 8,
with a circular aperture at either end, each of which was kept
open during the construction of the cell, and then closed.
The gauze itself, covered with silk, formed the ceiling of the
cell, while the floor was made of silk attached to the earth,
and the sides of strong and rather opaque silk.</p>

<p>This cell bore no resemblance to any portion of any trap-door
nest that I have ever seen, and it is difficult to conceive
how the idea of such a structure presented itself to the spider.
Its outline indeed had some likeness to the general outline of
the spider herself, one loop of the figure 8 being rather smaller
than the other. The distance between the floor and the
ceiling of this impromptu cell was a little over half an inch,
its width varying from one inch in the broadest to eight lines
in the narrowest part, while its length was an inch and a
quarter.</p>

<p>It would appear that the object which the spider had in view
was to construct a warm and secure retreat for the winter, and
accordingly after having completed this chamber, she no longer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[ 150 ]</a></span>
made excursions to catch the flies with which I supplied her,
but remained self-immured in her cell.<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_106" id="Footnote_106"></a><a href="#FNanchor_106"><span class="label">[106]</span></a> My observations on the captive spider were still in progress at the time
of going to print, so that the above notes must be considered as incomplete.</p></div>

<p>It would be interesting to discover whether any of the
spiders of this group (but which do not construct trap-door
nests) pass the winter in similar structures.</p>

<p class="caption4nb"><i>On the Structure of Cork Doors.</i></p>

<p>In order to test my theory to the effect that the trap-door
nests are enlarged from time to time, and that the numbers
of layers of silk in an undisturbed cork door should represent
the number of enlargements which the nest has undergone, I
examined the doors of twenty-eight nests of the cork type (all
I believe of <i>N. c&aelig;mentaria</i>), in order to prove whether as a
rule the larger cork doors do contain more layers of silk than
the small ones, as they should on this hypothesis.</p>

<p>The apparent exceptions to this rule, in which the larger
doors have fewer layers than some of the smaller ones, may
probably be accounted for in the following manner.</p>

<p>During the heavy rains and in times of drought flakes of
earth often become detached from the sloping banks, and
carry away the doors of such nests as are found in them.</p>

<p>This happens frequently, and the spiders hasten to repair
the damage and spin new doors.</p>

<p>But I have found, on examining eight of these new doors,
that, even in large nests,<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> they do not then contain more than
three layers of silk; so that each time a nest of any size loses

original and apparently undisturbed doors measured 3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>, 4, 5,
5, 5, and 5 lines across, and contained respectively 5, 7, 8, 13,
9 and 5 layers of silk; while of the equally large doors which
replaced them five contained three layers of silk only, and the
remaining nest but a single layer.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_108" id="Footnote_108"></a><a href="#FNanchor_108"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> While these pages were passing through the press (Hy&egrave;res, Oct. '74),
I have had an opportunity of examining 17 additional specimens of <i>N. congener</i>.
I learn from this that the pattern represented on the caput in fig. A 5,
does not accord with that in the majority of adult specimens, being usually
less defined and composed of three converging bands. Mr. Pickard-Cambridge's
description (p. 293 below) is, however, quite correct. I may
mention that three spines were present on the patella (genual joint) of
legs III in 16 specimens, the 17th specimen having but a single spine.</p>

<h1><a name="SUPPLEMENT1" id="SUPPLEMENT1">SUPPLEMENT<br />
TO<br />
HARVESTING ANTS.</a></h1>


<p>During the short time which has elapsed since <i>Harvesting
Ants and Trap-door Spiders</i> left the printer's
hands, fresh material has rapidly accumulated, and
an assiduous search after these creatures, and the
continued study of their works and ways, has met
with ample reward and encouragement.</p>

<p>It was my wish, when originally publishing these
observations, many of which were due to the active
co-operation of friends, to invite my readers to take
part with me in my pleasure and pursuits, so that we
should from that time work together, and, by communicating
our discoveries to each other, increase our
knowledge, and at the same time enlarge the field of
our research. My intention was that we should
leave to others the necessary work of collection,
preservation, and arrangement, and that, while our
fellow naturalists pin specimens into classified cabinets,
and devote long hours to the description of
peculiarities of form and colour, we should undertake
the lighter task of complementing their labours by
observing and recording the habits and conditions of
existence of the creatures themselves.</p>

<p>Looked at in this light, the present pages and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[ 158 ]</a></span>
those of the preceding work may be regarded as so
many drawers in our <i>Cabinet of Habits</i>, and though,
as we open drawer after drawer, many gaps and
blank spaces remind us how much remains to be
done in order to complete the collection, yet the
interest and suggestiveness of the specimen-facts already
secured, should encourage and direct us onwards.
There have not been wanting instances in
which my readers have associated themselves with
me in the way indicated, and it is with pleasure,
when reviewing the entire work, that I recall how
many of its most interesting features are due to the
researches and assistance of friends,<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> and commemorate
at once their discoveries and unfailing kindness.
I had certainly expected that before this time some
new species of harvesting ants would have been discovered,
either on the Riviera, where attention has
been especially called to the subject, or in other parts
of Europe, where dissimilar conditions might have
been expected to be associated with a different fauna;
but this has hitherto not been the case.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_109" id="Footnote_109"></a><a href="#FNanchor_109"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> To all who have rendered me this valuable help I tender my cordial
thanks. I am under very special obligations to Mr. Pickard-Cambridge,
for descriptions of spiders, and to Mr. F. Smith for the names of the Ants;
assistance which I should have found it almost impossible to dispense with or
to replace.</p></div>

<p>One might naturally suppose that if harvesting ants
were discovered in localities very widely distant from
each other, they would prove to belong to different
species, but thus far, both in Europe and Northern
Africa, it is the same two well-known species of <i>Atta
barbara</i> and <i>A. structor</i> that constantly reappear.</p>

<p>For instance, I have recently learned that harvesting
ants are found at Cadenabbia on the lake of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[ 159 ]</a></span>
Como, and at Montpellier in Southern France; but
on examination, the ants from the former place are
clearly seen to belong to the species <i>structor</i>, and
those from Montpellier to the two species <i>structor</i> and
<i>barbara</i>.</p>

<p>I was greatly interested to receive specimens of
ants, and of the seeds which they were carrying and
storing beneath the stones of a paved road at Cadenabbia,
for this is the northernmost point<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> at which
the habit of harvesting has as yet been noted. This
discovery suggests the possibility of the occurrence of
the habit in the warmer and more sheltered of the
Swiss valleys. When at Montpellier in May last I
frequently observed long trains of ants bringing
seeds and small dry fruits to their nests, but these
harvesters also turned out on close inspection to be
<i>Atta structor</i> and <i>A. barbara</i>, with its red-headed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[ 160 ]</a></span>
variety. These, it will be remembered, are the only
species of European ants which have as yet been
proved to be harvesters and seed-storers in the fullest
sense of the term, that is to say, which not only
gather and carry seeds, but also store them in large
quantities below the surface of the ground.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_110" id="Footnote_110"></a><a href="#FNanchor_110"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> I have related in a note at the foot of p. 4 in <i>Ants and Spiders</i> how
<i>Formica nigra</i> in England, though paying no attention to seeds generally, will
sometimes collect the fresh seeds of the sweet violet (<i>Viola odorata</i>).
</p>

<p>When I published this account I was quite unaware that the fact that certain
English ants collect sweet violet seeds had been observed by Mr. R. Wakefield
forty years before.</p>

<p>This was communicated by Mr. Wakefield in a letter to Mr. John Curtis, the
substance of which was read before the Linnean Society in 1854, and published
in their Proceedings (see Proceedings of the Linnean Society, ii. 293), where we
read: "He (Mr. Wakefield) states that he has seen the black species (<i>Formica
nigra</i>, L.) for days and nights together industriously occupied in dragging to
its cells the seeds of the common violet (<i>Viola odorata</i>, L.)</p>

<p>"He first noticed this fact on the 3rd of July, 1832; and he regards it as a
curious subject of inquiry for what purpose, if not for their own future provision,
they could accumulate these stores?" Mr. Wakefield appears to accept this as
evidence that these ants possess the habit of storing seeds; but this is not so, as
will be seen by reference to my note alluded to above, and I am inclined to
believe that they collect these particular seeds either under the mistaken
belief that they are larv&aelig;, to which when fresh they bear some resemblance, or
for the sake of some juices which they may obtain from the fleshy appendage
attached to the seed.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_111" id="Footnote_111"></a><a href="#FNanchor_111"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> Six other species belonging to the genus <i>Atta</i> are found in Europe, but they
are all unknown to me.</p>

<p>It seems likely that, if other harvesting ants do exist in Europe they may
belong to one of these six species; for we have seen (<i>Ants and Spiders</i>, p. 59)
that all the ants which are known to possess this habit are either members of
the genus <i>Atta</i> or belong to genera closely related to it.</p></div>

<p>In the case of <i>Pheidole megacephala</i> (the only other
European ant which I have detected collecting seeds
in large numbers), I have never been able to find
granaries or subterranean stores of any kind, though
I have frequently made extensive search for them,
and explored, to all appearance, the whole nest.</p>

<p>When we remember the great variety of ants
which inhabit Europe alone (a recent list<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> enumerating
no fewer than 104 distinct species), it certainly
may seem strange at first that only two of their
number should possess this habit. Perhaps, however,
we may yet discover that some other of these species
are true harvesters; but at present the chances seem
rather against it, since the harvesters found at such
distant points as Algiers, Cadenabbia, and Montpellier
have all turned out to belong to one or other
of the two species, <i>structor</i> or <i>barbara</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_112" id="Footnote_112"></a><a href="#FNanchor_112"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> <i>Description des Fourmis d'Europe pour servir &agrave; l'&eacute;tude des insectes
myrmecophilis</i>, by Ernest Andr&eacute;, in <i>Rev. et Mag. de Zool.</i> 3<sup>e</sup> ser. tom. ii.
(1874), p. 152, &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>Indeed it may very well be that the numerical
superiority and wide distribution of these two species
have served to secure to them a more or less exclusive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[ 161 ]</a></span>
right to the habit of harvesting, for it is clear that a
given tract of country can only afford supplies of
grain to a limited number of colonies; so that, if
these ants have taken up the ground and are strong
enough to maintain possession, no others would have
a chance. However this may be, I find that the
more insight I gain into the distinctive habits and
relations of animals, the more the belief impresses
itself upon me that wherever we find many closely-allied
species inhabiting restricted areas, there we
may safely look for important differences among these
species in respect of their modes of life, and in the
development of their instinct and intelligence. And
indeed this may be considered as a corollary of the
great law of natural selection, which uniformly tends
to secure the greatest possible amount of divergence
in this respect, and to prevent the co-existence in close
proximity to each other of distinct species having the
same requirements and manner of life.</p>

<p>Thus, for example, even <i>Atta barbara</i> and <i>structor</i>,
though most closely related as species, differ in habit;
the former leading a much more active life during
the winter months at Mentone than the latter, and
seeking its home rather in wild than cultivated ground.
Then what differences different ants present in respect
of strength, speed, powers of offence and defence,
numerical strength of colonies, timidity, date and
frequency of departure of winged ants from the nest,
odour emitted, combativeness, architecture and selection
of localities, nature of food, nocturnal and
diurnal habits, and in many other properties and conditions!
It is doubtless owing to dissimilarity in
these and other respects that it becomes possible for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[ 162 ]</a></span>
so many species to co-exist within very narrow limits,
so that even three or four distinct kinds sometimes
form their nests so close to each other that their
galleries interlace and almost touch.</p>

<p>There are probably very few conditions of life
(except those concerned with the nature and manner
of obtaining food) which have a greater influence
either in keeping creatures apart or in bringing them
into collision, than those which constitute differences
in their respective periods of activity and development.
Thus, two species of which one has nocturnal and the
other diurnal habits, or of which one is dormant while
the other is active, may be said to travel different
roads and to be complete strangers to one another.
Complete separation of this kind is, of course, not the
rule, and the greater number of species find themselves
in more or less constant rivalry, but possess a
sufficient number of points of dissimilarity in habit
and requirements to make their co-existence possible.</p>

<p>It is curious to note what little differences, as they
seem to us, may determine the fate of an ant. For
example, the lizards will lie in wait for and greedily
seize and devour the winged males and females of
<i>structor</i> and <i>barbara</i>, though they dare not attack the
assembled workers. It is curious to watch the way
in which these worker ants will protect the winged
ants which are about to leave the nest, by gathering
round and swarming over them. When, as often
happens, the nest is placed in an old terrace-wall, one
may see the lizards creeping along or lying moulded
into the inequalities of the stones, all having their
eager eyes directed towards the swarm. One may
then see the worker ants walk with impunity straight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[ 163 ]</a></span>
up to the very noses of the lizards, while the male or
female which should chance to straggle in the same
direction would infallibly be eaten up. The lizards
plainly show their fear of the workers by the way in
which, when they make up their mind to try a dash
at some outlying part of the ant colony, they leap
through the lines in the utmost haste as if traversing
a ring of fire.</p>

<p>Now these worker ants are destitute of stings, and
I can only suppose that their power of combination,
stronger jaws and more horny coats, have gained
them this immunity. I remarked that the smaller
lizards appeared to have some difficulty in dealing
with the males and females which they captured, and
would beat and pound them against the stones before
devouring them, while the larger ones would often
make but one mouthful of them, swallowing wings
and all!</p>

<p>If it were not for this body-guard of workers it is
difficult to see how the males and females in such
situations could ever escape. It is also plain that if
the worker harvesting ants were as liable to be seized
and devoured as their winged companions, the species
would soon become extinct, for they expose themselves
more than ants ordinarily do, and their long provision-laden
trains would be almost at the mercy of
any enemy which could attack them without fear of
results.<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_113" id="Footnote_113"></a><a href="#FNanchor_113"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> Speaking of the enemies of ants, I may mention having seen a young robin
in England picking up and swallowing the workers of <i>Formica nigra</i> just as
if they were crumbs. I knew that birds would eat the male and female ants,
but I had thought the workers were exempt from their attacks, and, indeed,
they must be so as a rule, for otherwise they would speedily become extinct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[ 164 ]</a></span></p></div>

<p>Remembering this, it is interesting to note how
differently the tiger-beetle (<i>Cicendela</i>) behaves when
hunting the powerful harvesting ants and when
preying upon the weak little <i>Formica (Tapinoma)
erratica</i>; for, while it seizes the latter without taking
any precautions, it is evidently more than half afraid
of the former.</p>

<p>I have seen this beetle lying in wait near a train
of <i>structor</i> or <i>barbara</i> ants, watching until some individual
separated a little from the main body, when it
would rush forward and make a snap at it, retiring
again as quickly as it came. If the tiger-beetle fails
to seize its prey exactly behind the head it will let it
go again, and two or three ants are often thus cruelly
mutilated before a single one is carried off.</p>

<p>No doubt the beetle has learned that if once this
ant clasps its mandibles upon either antenn&aelig; or legs,
nothing, not even death itself, will make it release
its hold. It therefore tries to pin the ant in such a
way that it cannot use its formidable jaws. Perhaps
the habit of forming long compact trains may have
been acquired by the ants partly with a view to
guarding against attacks of this kind.</p>

<p>The colonies of the little <i>F. erratica</i>, on the other
hand, apparently have to trust to their habit of
working under the covered ways which they construct,
as well as to their activity and great numbers
for their preservation.</p>

<p>I had thought that the very powerful, and, to me,
disagreeable, odour of these little ants might have
rendered them distasteful to the tiger-beetle, but this
is evidently not the case.</p>

<p>I have said above that, as far as our present knowledge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[ 165 ]</a></span>
goes, only two out of the 104 species of European
ants are possessed of the habit of collecting and
storing seed, and it may be reasonably asked how it
can have come about, if this is the case, that the
ancient authors were so well acquainted with the fact.</p>

<p>The explanation is that these writers lived on the
shores of the Mediterranean, where these two species&mdash;<i>Atta
barbara</i> and <i>structor</i>&mdash;are extremely common
objects, both on account of their abundance and their
habits. The long trains of harvesters remain exposed
to view for hours together, and <i>structor</i> seeks the
neighbourhood or even the interior of towns, so that
these ants arrest the attention even of the unobservant,
and often become familiar as the sparrows.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that these two ants
display the same habits throughout all the warmer
districts which they inhabit, but whether they do so
in Switzerland, Germany, Northern France, and the
other colder portions of their range, remains one of
the many interesting questions which still await
investigation.</p>

<p>Mr. F. Smith has recorded the presence of <i>Atta
barbara</i> in Palestine, and I have lately obtained some
curious evidence which goes to show that harvesting
ants not only carried on their operations in times
past in that country, but that their seed-stores were
on a much larger scale than any I have observed on
the Riviera.</p>

<p>I am indebted to Dr. F. A. Pratt for the information
that mention was made of ants and their
stores in the Misna, that codification of the traditionary
and unwritten laws of the Jews, which was
commenced after the birth of Christ under the presidency
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[ 166 ]</a></span>
of Hillel, and which has at least the merit of
serving as a record of a multitude of very ancient
customs and observances which, but for it, would probably
have long ago been forgotten.</p>

<p>Now it so happens that the very first section of
the Misna is called <i>Zeraim</i>, and has to do with seeds
and crops, and I was thus enabled, without any very
prolonged search, to light upon one of the passages
in question.<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> It occurs in a chapter entitled <i>De
Angulo</i> in the Latin version, treating of the <i>corner</i> of
the fields bearing crops which should be set aside for
the poor, and of the rights of the gleaners, and may
be freely rendered as follows: "The granaries of ants
(<i>Formicarum cavernul&aelig;</i>), which may be found in the
midst of a growing crop of corn, shall belong to the
owner of the crop; but, if these granaries are found
after the reapers have passed, the upper part (of each
heap contained in these granaries) shall go to the
poor and the lower to the proprietor." And then is
added: "The Rabbi Meir is of opinion that the
whole should go to the poor, because whenever any
doubt arises about a question of gleaning the doubt
is to be given in favour of the gleaner."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_114" id="Footnote_114"></a><a href="#FNanchor_114"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> "Formicarum cavernul&aelig; in media segete proprietarii censentur; pone
messores superiore parte pauperum, inferiore proprietarii. R. Meir totum
pauperum esse censet, quia quod dubium est in spicelegio, spicilegium est."
And to this the following explanatory note is appended: "Formicarum
cavernul&aelig;, Frumentum inibi repertum." Misna, Sect. I. Zeraim. Cap. IV. p.

<p>The intention of this very quaint bit of legislation,
or rather of the ancient custom which gave rise to it,
appears to have been the following; it was to settle
once and for all a nice point of conscience with reference
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[ 167 ]</a></span>
to the claims of the poor upon these ant stores.
If the heaps of grain were found among the standing
corn before the reapers reached the spot or while
they were still at work, the proprietor might claim
them without any hesitation; but, if they were discovered
after the passing of the reapers, then it was
conceivable that the ants, which during the whole time
had never ceased their labours, might have collected
some of the grain from the fallen ears of corn which
lay upon the ground, and were the property of the
gleaners. These grains would be those which the
ants had collected most recently, and would therefore
lie on the surface of each granary heap. Thus it was
settled that the upper portion of each heap should
belong to the poor, and the lower, that collected from
the standing crop, to the proprietor.</p>

<p>We may perhaps laugh at the notion of critically
discussing and legislating upon such a subject, and
think that such a pitiful matter might have been
allowed to pass among those <i>minima</i> about which even
the Jewish law need not care.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, it is interesting for us to learn
that a custom of the kind had its place among the
recognised traditions of the people, and that the
harvesting ants of Syria had earned a place in these
records by amassing stores of sufficient size, and so
disposed as to make them worth collecting.</p>

<p>This reminds us of what M. Germain de St. Pierre
has related (<i>Ants and Spiders</i>, p. 29) of the extent of
the depredations made among the corn crops at
Hy&egrave;res by these ants; and doubtless other observers
who have opportunities for watching the ants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[ 168 ]</a></span>
during the summer months might supply further confirmation.</p>

<p>It would be of interest to learn the extent and
manner of concealment of these large stores of grain,
but, during the months from October to May, I have
never seen corn in any quantity in the granaries,
though there was frequent evidence of its late presence
in the dense masses of husks of oats and other
large grain lying near the nests. In October, 1873, I
found near the entrances to a nest of <i>structor</i> a circular
mound formed of this refuse, twenty-seven inches in
diameter, and averaging two inches in thickness, while
near other nests I have found the chinks between
the stones of the terrace-wall behind which the nest
lay, literally stuffed with husks. It was plain that
these grains of cereals and the larger grasses had been
collected during the summer. The granaries in the
winter and spring contain the grains of some few of
the autumnal grasses, but are principally filled with
seeds of the other more abundant autumn-fruiting
plants belonging to the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>I have now collected from the granaries of these
ants the seeds or small dry fruits of fifty-four distinct
species of wild plants, and on examination I find that
during my stay in the south (from October to May)
the seeds of the distinctively spring and summer-flowering
plants are either entirely absent or are very
scarce, while the great bulk of the seeds belong to
plants which ripen their fruits in the autumn.
Thus the grains of oats, of the large fescue and brome
grasses, of quaking grasses (<i>Melica</i>), and other kinds
common near the nests in May, are conspicuously
absent in the winter, as are the fruits of all the sedges
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[ 169 ]</a></span>
but one, and this one (<i>Carex distans</i>) retains its fruits
till late in the autumn. Among other spring-flowering
plants common near the nests, the seeds of which are also
absent, I may mention violets (<i>Viola odorata</i>), poppies,
(<i>Papaver</i>), certain species of <i>Veronica</i>, <i>Helianthemum
guttatum</i>, <i>Silene quinque-vulnera</i> and <i>Plantago Bellardi</i>.</p>

<p>Here a curious question arises&mdash;viz., What becomes
of the large stores of seeds which one may still find
in the nests in May, when the ants are busy pouring
fresh supplies into the nest? The answer probably is,
that, as the weather becomes warmer, ever-increasing
calls are made by the larv&aelig; upon the food-resources
of the nest, and that old and new seeds rapidly disappear
together, and all the energy and activity of
the colony is needed to meet the increased demand.</p>

<p>Still, it would be interesting, if it were possible,
to assure oneself whether this is the case; that
is to say, whether the residue of the winter
stores is really consumed during the summer, or
whether a portion of it remains in the granaries until
the following autumn. One might perhaps learn
something as to this if one had an opportunity of
opening a nest late in July, and before the characteristic
autumn-fruiting plants had set their seed.
If the granaries were then principally filled with seeds
of spring-fruiting plants, and the winter seeds were
almost or entirely absent, this would afford tolerably
good negative evidence in favour of the latter having
been eaten during the summer.</p>

<p>One thing is certain, and that is, that these harvesting
ants do not habitually abandon their nests every year.
On the contrary, while many swarms leave the nests at
different seasons, a portion of the original colony, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[ 170 ]</a></span>
of its descendants, still remains in the old home, and
very few out of the many nests which I have watched
during the past three years, and of which I have
noted and mapped the positions, have been deserted.
On my return to Mentone in October, 1873, I hastened
to examine the nests between which war had
been carried on in the previous year (<i>Ants and Spiders</i>,
p. 38), and found in one case that the vanquished nest
was completely lifeless and abandoned, while the victorious
colony was remarkably thriving, and its granaries
teemed with seeds. The locality occupied by
the other belligerent colonies had unfortunately been
built over.</p>

<p>I have often been asked whether I could give an
approximate estimate of the quantity of seeds contained
in a nest of average size, but I have hitherto felt
unable to do this in a satisfactory manner. I am now
in possession of more reliable data, and believe that
the following calculation may be taken as a near
approximation to the truth. During the spring of
1873 I removed with but very little loss the contents
of two granaries from a very extensive nest of <i>Atta
structor</i>, consisting principally of seeds of clover, fumitory,
and pellitory. These seeds, when perfectly clean
and freed from earth, weighed in the one case
4 sc. 4 grs., and in the other 5 sc. 8 grs. Now
there cannot have been less than eighty such granaries
in this nest, so that, if we take five scruples as the
average weight of the seeds in each granary, and this,
allowing for loss in collection, which we may fairly
do, we should have a total weight of more than sixteen
ounces, or one pound avoirdupois weight of seeds contained
in the nest. But, though this mass of seeds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[ 171 ]</a></span>
represents the result of infinite labour on the part of
the ants, each individual granary contains but an
insignificant quantity, and the store-chambers often
lie at great distances apart; it is therefore impossible
to believe that the stores alluded to in the
Misna can have been as small and scattered as these
were, and we must, on the contrary, suppose them to
have been both larger and more accessible.<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_115" id="Footnote_115"></a><a href="#FNanchor_115"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> Perhaps these heaps of corn may have been piled up at the entrance to the
nest, as is sometimes the case when the workers, in their eagerness to secure as
much as possible of a passing harvest, bring in the supplies too fast for their
companions within the nest to be able to find room for and accommodate. When
this happens the seeds lie outside the nest until fresh chambers are prepared
for their reception.</p></div>

<p>The means employed by the ants to prevent the
germination of the seeds contained in their granaries
still remain secret, and all the experiments and investigations
which I have hitherto been able to make
have failed to give me the clue.</p>

<p>The problem to be solved is the following: Given
seeds, the readiness of which to germinate has been
proved, to place them in damp soil at depths varying
from half an inch to twenty inches below the surface
in such a manner that they shall remain there dormant,
neither germinating nor decaying, for weeks
and even months. These very seeds must be capable
of germinating after the conclusion of the experiment.</p>

<p>This is what the ants do for millions of seeds, for
the instances in which a few seeds appear to have
sprouted within the nest in defiance of the ants, are
very rare and wholly exceptional; and when after
prolonged wet weather germinated seeds are seen
outside the nest, it will usually be found that these
have the little root cut off, and are eventually carried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[ 172 ]</a></span>
back into the nest and used as food. By a fortunate
chance I have been able to prove that the seeds will
germinate in an undisturbed granary when the ants
are prevented from obtaining access to it; and this
goes to show not only that the structure and nature
of the granary chamber is not sufficient of itself to
prevent germination, but also that the presence of the
ants is essential to secure the dormant condition of
the seeds.</p>

<p>I discovered in two places portions of distinct nests
of <i>Atta structor</i> which had been isolated owing to the
destruction of the terrace-wall behind which they lay,
and there the granaries were filled up and literally
choked with growing seeds, though the earth in
which they lay completely enclosed and concealed
them, until by chance I laid them bare! In one case
I knew that the destruction of the wall had only
taken place ten days before, so that the seeds had
sprouted in this interval.</p>

<p>My experiments also tend to confirm this, and to
favour the belief that the non-germination of the
seeds is due to some direct influence voluntarily exercised
by the ants, and not merely to the conditions
found in the nest, or to acid vapours which in certain
cases are given off by the ants themselves.</p>

<p>In order to put this latter point to the test of
experiment, I confined about a hundred harvesting
ants (<i>A. structor</i>), with their queen and several larv&aelig;,
in a glass test-tube eight inches long and one inch in
diameter, closed with a cork and filled up to within
about an inch of the cork with damp sandy soil, most
of which was taken from the ants' nest.</p>

<p>I added six peas, six cress and six millet, and then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[ 173 ]</a></span>
kept the tube tightly corked for nine days, only once
removing the cork for a few seconds in order to
sprinkle a little water on the ants, which were evidently
in need of it. On the ninth day I turned out
the contents of the tube and found that all the peas,
millet and cress, had germinated and were growing
strongly. One of the cress, however, had had its
root, which lay across the gallery constructed by
the ants, gnawed off; four clover seeds, which had
come with the soil taken from the nest, and which
had formed part of the ants' stores, had germinated
also. Here the small quantity of air contained
in the test-tube must certainly have become saturated
with any vapour which the ants may be supposed
to give off, and we cannot therefore accept this
as the cause of the dormant condition of the granary
seeds.</p>

<p>I made other experiments in which harvesting ants
were imprisoned along with various seeds in small,
cylindrical, closed vessels containing a little damp
sand. Here the vessels were frequently rolled from
side to side or shaken, during the twenty-two hours
for which the experiment lasted, so as to excite the
ants and make them give off such odours as they
possessed, but no trace of injurious influence was
produced upon the seeds, which germinated and grew
normally afterwards.</p>

<p>At Mr. Darwin's suggestion I made a long series
of experiments with formic acid, in which measured
quantities, pure or diluted, were placed in a watch-glass
on damp sand and surrounded by seeds, the
whole being enclosed in a covered tumbler, so that
the effects produced on the seeds by the vapour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[ 174 ]</a></span>
rising from the acid might be noted. Similar seeds
were sown at the same time and in the same way,
but without the acid, so as to permit of comparison.
These experiments have afforded some interesting
results,<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> but do not supply any positive data which
might help us to discover the secret of the ants.
They narrow, indeed, the area in which search can
profitably be made, indicating as they do that the
vapour of formic acid is incapable of rendering the
seeds dormant after the manner of the ants, and
showing, on the contrary, that its influence is always
injurious to the seeds, even when present only in
excessively minute quantities.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_116" id="Footnote_116"></a><a href="#FNanchor_116"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> I hope shortly to offer these observations, together with another series of a
similar nature in which my friend Mr. J. B. Andrews has taken part, to the
Linnean Society.</p></div>

<p>It appears to me now that the most promising
field for experiments made with a view to clearing up
this difficulty, is that afforded by the closer investigation
of the phenomena of normal germination, and
by a study of the conditions under which seeds
remain dormant, as they are occasionally known to
do, in situations which our general experience would
have selected as favourable to germination.</p>

<p>I have good hopes, also, that when we come
to know more of the habits of harvesting ants in
tropical countries, and when naturalists have excavated
and described their subterranean stores&mdash;a thing
which has not yet been done as far as I know&mdash;we
may gather fresh indications to guide us in our
search.</p>

<p>I am puzzled to account for the fact, which I have
seen stated by more than one observer in India, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[ 175 ]</a></span>
the ants there have a habit of bringing out large
quantities of grain and seed and laying them in heaps
outside their nests at the commencement of the wet
season. Dr. King, the director of the Royal Botanic
Gardens at Calcutta, has told me that when in the
Gwalior territory during the beginning of the rainy
season, he saw heaps of seeds, principally those of a
leguminous plant (<i>Alyssocarpus</i>), piled up round the
entrances to the ants' nests, and that it was precisely
at that time that flocks of a rock-grouse (<i>Pterocles
exustus</i>) first made their appearance. They fed freely
upon the seeds, and Dr. King found the crops of
some of these birds, which he had shot, filled with
them.</p>

<p>It is difficult to imagine why these Indian ants
should turn out from their nests the very seeds which
it had cost them so much labour to collect, and the
more so as we find that these seeds are devoured by
birds. It seems just possible, however, that the ants,
remaining torpid during the rainy season, do not
require the seeds, and know that, under these circumstances,
if left in the nest, they would sprout,
and choke up the galleries and granaries. Perhaps
also they may have learned that a certain number of
the ejected seeds will spring up and afford future
harvests within easy reach of the nest.</p>

<p>All this, however, and especially the suggestion as
to the dormant condition of the ants during the rainy
season, might easily be proved or disproved by direct
observation; and at present we have nothing but
mere speculation to go upon.</p>

<p>It is curious to find that the native population in a
certain part of India pay a kind of tribute to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[ 176 ]</a></span>
ants, for Dr. King informs me that the Hindoos in
Rajputana, a province in which the old traditions and
superstitions retain especial hold, have a custom of
scattering dry rice and sugar for the ants, and thus
apparently recognise both their love of sweet things
and their habit of collecting seeds. It may be that
this custom is now little more than a meaningless
rite; but in the past it probably had its origin, either
in a wish to propitiate the good will and avert the
destructive attacks of creatures which are the scourge
and dread of entire districts, or in a sentiment of
combined fear and admiration&mdash;fear of the power,
and admiration of the energy, forethought, perseverance,
and sense of duty to the community displayed
by these marvellous insects.</p>

<p>That the latter feeling may have had some share in
prompting this act is suggested by another custom
which is stated<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> to prevail in Arabia, in accordance
with which an ant is placed in the hand of a newly-born
child, in order that its virtues may pass into
and possess the infant.</p>

vol. iv. p. 339, where he quotes from a local dictionary.</p></div>

<p>Among the many curious and obscure features in
the economy of ants, one of the most interesting is
the occasional presence in their nests of different
creatures which live among and often in harmony
with them, the nature of the relations between host
and guest being for the most part quite unknown.</p>

<p>When examining the contents of some granaries
from an extensive nest of <i>Atta structor</i> at Mentone
last spring (1874), I found large numbers of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[ 177 ]</a></span>
minute, shining-brown beetle moving about among
the seeds. These little creatures were themselves not
unlike some very small seeds, and were of an elliptic
form, measuring a trifle less than one line in length.
They proved to belong to the scarce and very restricted
genus <i>Coluocera</i>.<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> This species, named by
Kraatz <i>C. att&aelig;</i>, on account of its inhabiting the nests
of ants belonging to the genus <i>Atta</i>, has been found
in Greece.</p>

<p>Mr. Bates,<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> in his most interesting account of his
travels on the Amazons, remarks upon the singular
fact, of which the above instance is an example:
"that some of the most anomalous forms of Coleopterous
insects are those which live solely in the nests of
ants," and he then goes on to allude to the strange
snake <i>Amphisb&aelig;na</i>, a native of that region, which also
lives in the nests of the Sauba ants (<i>&#338;codoma cephalotes</i>),
observing how curious it is that an abnormal
form of snakes should be found in the society of these
insects. He is of opinion, however, that the <i>Amphisb&aelig;na</i>
is not an inoffensive guest, but lives upon the
ants whose nest it selects for its home.</p>

<p>Another remarkable inhabitant of ants' nests is a
minute cricket, of which I found a single example in
the midst of a colony of black ants at Mentone in
February, 1874. This miniature cricket is scarcely
as large as a grain of wheat, the body, excluding the
antenn&aelig; and other appendages, measuring only two
lines in length. It has been described by Dr. Paolo
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[ 178 ]</a></span>
Savi<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> under the name of <i>Gryllus myrmecophilus</i>. He
detected it in the nests of several species of ants in
Tuscany, where it lived on the best terms with its
hosts, playing round their nests in warm, and retiring
into them in stormy weather, while allowing the
ants to carry it from place to place during their
migrations.</p>

<i>Bibliotheco Italiana</i>, tom. xv. p. 217.</p></div>

<p><i>Gryllus myrmecophilus</i> has also been observed in
nests of the turf ant (<i>Tetramorium c&aelig;spitum</i>) near
Paris.<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>At Mentone I have never found more than this
one specimen, and the ants among which it was
domiciliated were of a species new to me (<i>Camponotus</i>
(<i>Formica</i>) <i>lateralis</i>, Oliv.). This colony of ants was
composed of many winged males and females, as well
as workers, the last-named measuring from two and a
half to three lines in length, and black in colour. In
other colonies I have found the workers black, with
red head and thorax.</p>

<p>Another ant, not enumerated in my list in <i>Ants
and Spiders</i>, is <i>Camponotus</i> (<i>Formica</i>) <i>sylvatica</i>, which
I detected in March last under stones on Cap Martin,
near Mentone. When disturbed, this ant runs along
with its abdomen raised vertically in the air, much as
the devil's coachhorse (<i>Staphylinus</i>) does. The same
curious habit of erecting the abdomen is found in
another ant, not uncommon in decaying wood in the
South, <i>Crematogaster scutellaris</i>; and probably all
three insects adopt this threatening attitude, which is
that of the scorpion preparing to strike and sting, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[ 179 ]</a></span>
order to intimidate their enemies, though <i>Crematogaster</i>
is the only one which really possesses a sting.</p>

<p><i>Camponotus sylvatica</i> has the same long legs and
slender body as <i>Formica cursor</i>, and is of about the
same size; the workers, which are of a dark brown
colour, measuring about 3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> lines in length.</p>

<p>Perhaps it may be well, in concluding these remarks
on Harvesting Ants, to call attention to the
principal questions which still await solution. The
first is one which any observer who travels in Central
Europe during the summer may help to solve.</p>

<p>1. Do <i>any</i> ants collect and store seed in Switzerland,
Germany, North France, England, or indeed in
any of the colder parts of the world?</p>

<p>2. What are the habits of <i>Atta structor</i> and <i>A.
barbara</i> when living, as they are known to do, in
Switzerland, Germany, and Northern France?</p>

<p>3. How do the ants contrive to preserve the seeds
in their granaries free from germination and decay?</p>

<p>4. How are the seed-stores of tropical ants disposed
below ground, and of what do they consist?</p>

<p>5. Do harvesting ants exist in the southern states
of North America, in Australia, New Zealand, or at
the Cape?</p>

TRAP-DOOR SPIDERS.</h1>


<p>There would doubtless be a just feeling of pride and
satisfaction in the heart of a naturalist who could say
that he had made himself thoroughly acquainted with
all the species of a particular group of animals, had
learned their most secret habits, and mastered their
several relations to the objects, animate and inanimate,
which surrounded them. But perhaps a still
keener pleasure is enjoyed by one who carries about
with him some problem of the kind but partially
solved, and who, holding in his hand the clue which
shall guide him onwards, sees in each new place that
he visits fresh opportunities of discovery. The latter
is certainly the condition of those who take an interest
in searching out the habits and characters of trap-door
spiders; for this subject, far from being exhausted,
expands under the light of recently acquired facts,
and invites research in many parts of Europe, north
as well as south.</p>

<p>We have only to compare the number of types of
trap-door nest which were known before the publication
of <i>Ants and Spiders</i>, with those at present recorded,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[ 181 ]</a></span>
to see how fruitful this field of inquiry has
already proved.</p>

<p>Before this little work was published, only one
type of trap-door nest was known in Europe: two
new types were described in its pages, and I have
now the pleasure of being able to bring three more
hitherto unknown European types before the notice
of my readers, thus raising the number to six in all.
I do not include in these six types the very curious,
and still imperfectly-known nest of <i>Atypus</i>;<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> a spider
which is a true representative of the trap-door group
as far as its structural characters are concerned, but
which, although it excavates a silk-lined burrow in
the earth, does not appear to construct any kind of
door at the mouth of its tube.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_122" id="Footnote_122"></a><a href="#FNanchor_122"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> See <i>Ants and Spiders</i>, page 78. <i>Atypus</i> belongs to the sub-family <i>Atypin&aelig;</i>,
a division which does not include any of the <i>Nemesias</i> or <i>Ctenizas</i>, and of
which indeed <i>Atypus</i> is the only European representative.</p></div>

<p>Much uncertainty still hangs over the habits of
this spider, as the facts hitherto recorded, though
perfectly authentic, are difficult to piece together into
a satisfactory whole. One thing, however, is clear,
and that is, that the nests and habits of the spiders
of the genus <i>Atypus</i> (of which, as Mr. Pickard-Cambridge,
informs me, two if not three distinct
species inhabit England) merit attentive study, and
would most certainly repay it. Hastings, Portland,
the coast of Dorsetshire, and the neighbourhood of
London and Exeter, are the habitats hitherto cited
for this spider, but I cannot doubt its existence in
many sheltered localities on the south coast of
England.</p>

<p>The most recent contribution to our knowledge of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[ 182 ]</a></span>
this genus is contained in a paper by M. Eug&egrave;ne
Simon,<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> who describes three species (two of which are
new), as inhabiting France, and it remains to be
ascertained whether our British <i>Atypi</i> agree in their
characters with any of these.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_123" id="Footnote_123"></a><a href="#FNanchor_123"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> Note sur les Esp&egrave;ces fran&ccedil;aises du genre <i>Atypus</i>, Latr. in Ann. Soc.
Entomologique de France, 5<sup>e</sup> ser. tom. iii. (1873), p. 109.</p></div>

<p>He describes (p. 113-4) the nest and mode of life
of <i>Atypus piceus</i>, Sulzer (=<i>A. Sulzeri</i>, Latr.),<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> the
commonest of the three species, as follows:&mdash;"They
(the spiders) seek dry and somewhat sandy slopes,
sometimes also woods, chiefly plantations of evergreens;
their retreat is always concealed either by
stones, or in moss which one must remove carefully
and in large masses (<i>pl&acirc;ques</i>) in order to detect
them."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_124" id="Footnote_124"></a><a href="#FNanchor_124"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> Thus named by M. Simon.</p></div>

<p>"This Atypus excavates an oblique hole of 15 to 20
centimetres deep, and of the size of its body; it lines
it with a rather narrow silken tube of a very close
texture, the upper part of which, exceeding the subterranean
portion in length, lies horizontally on the
surface of the ground, and ends in an open tapering
point. Near its lower extremity the tube is suddenly
contracted, and then dilates into the form of a fairly
spacious apartment, in which the spider lives; the
cocoon enclosing the eggs is suspended by a few
threads at the contraction. I have frequently surprised
<i>Atypus</i> in the act of holding earth-worms in
their falces, and I think that these Annelids constitute
the larger part of their food; indeed, if one
examines the lower portion of the silk chamber, one
may remark a part where the tissue is thinner and
more transparent. I have not been able to detect an
opening, but it is probable that the <i>Atypus</i> can easily
part the not very compact threads, and thus obtain
for itself an easy prey, and dispense with the necessity
of ascending to the surface of the ground. When
taken out of its tube, <i>Atypus</i> does not even attempt to
escape; it is therefore plain that it is not organized
for the pursuit of an active prey; and, on the other
hand, the upper extremity of the tube is ill-adapted
for an ambuscade, being almost closed, and without
support. This small opening would seem to be solely
intended for the entrance and exit of the male (a very
much smaller creature than the female) during the
breeding season, which occurs in the month of
October."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[ 183 ]</a></span></p>

<p>M. Simon says that this species of <i>Atypus</i> is
common in all the centre, east and west of France,
and that he has detected it in great abundance in the
neighbourhood of Troyes, in Champagne, in the
month of October, when the male was inhabiting the
same tube with the female.<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> I am greatly indebted
to M. Simon for having given me the specimen of a
silk tube taken entire from a nest found in this
locality, which I have figured in <a href="#Plate_XIII">Plate XIII</a>, fig. A. It
will be seen that the tube has collapsed, but one may
still trace the enlargement near the base which forms
the chamber, the elbow where it is bent at the surface
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[ 184 ]</a></span>
of the ground, the moss, scales, and fibres of plants
which are woven into, and serve to conceal the a&euml;rial
portion, and its termination in a twisted and apparently-closed
mouth.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_125" id="Footnote_125"></a><a href="#FNanchor_125"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> M. Simon has discovered another species of <i>Atypus</i> at Digne in the
Basses Alpes which constructs a similar nest to that described above. This
species was detected for the first time by M. Simon and described by him under
the name of <i>Atypus bleodonticus</i>.</p></div>

<p>Indeed, I believe that, in this specimen, the upper
extremity of the tube is really closed, for, when I
succeeded in inflating this a&euml;rial portion, the lips did
not part, but remained drawn together.</p>

<p>It seems very extraordinary that the mouth of the
tube should be thus closed, so that the female spider
becomes a prisoner, self-immured, and I can only
suppose that this is a temporary condition, limited
perhaps to the period during which she receives the
visits of the male.</p>

<p>At the very base of the tube I found a mass of
earth, roots and vegetable fibres, and in this I hoped
to have detected the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of insects or other food,
such as I sometimes find at the bottom of and below
the tubes of the trap-door nests in the South, but of
this there was no trace.</p>

<p>It is difficult to me to imagine how the spider
could contrive to live by the capture of worms, after
the fashion suggested by M. Simon; for who does
not know the speed with which, on the slightest
alarm, worms draw back into their holes and escape
pursuit, and the muscular power which they exert
in resisting any attempts to drag them out of the
earth?</p>

<p>M. Simon's account of the closed tube and capture
of worms by this spider corresponds, however, with
that given by Mr. Joshua Brown, the first discoverer
of <i>Atypus</i> in England.</p>

<p>This gentleman communicated his discovery to Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[ 185 ]</a></span>
Edward Newman<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> in 1856, since which time (with
the exception of M. Simon's paper quoted above)
little or nothing seems to have been done to clear up
the points which remain doubtful in the history of
these singular creatures.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_126" id="Footnote_126"></a><a href="#FNanchor_126"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> Note on <i>Atypus Sulzeri</i> of Latreille, by Mr. Edward Newman, read before
the Linnean Society; a report of this communication is given in <i>The Zoologist</i>,
vol. xiv. (1856), p. 5021.</p></div>

<p>Several nests of <i>Atypus</i> were discovered by Mr.
Joshua Brown in the neighbourhood of Hastings,
when traversing a lane bounded on either side by
high and steep sand-banks, partially covered with
grass and bushes.</p>

<p>His attention was at first arrested by the sight of
"something hanging down which looked like the
cocoon of some moth;" but, on closer examination,
the silk case proved to be empty, and was continued
as a tube into the ground to a depth of 9 inches,
where he came upon the spider lying at the bottom.
Further research revealed the existence of a number
of these nests in the same locality, but the length of
the different tubes varied much; they were usually
about 9 inches long, but some were much longer,
often baffling his attempts to follow them; the longest
which he was able to secure entire measured 11 inches.
All the nests were, however, alike in having a tubular
silk lining, about <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> of an inch in diameter, a part of
which protruded from the ground for about 2 inches,
and was pendent, inflated, and covered with particles
of sand, assimilating it to the surrounding surface; it
was closed at the upper extremity, leaving no exit to
the open air.</p>

<p>Mr. Brown took home some of these tubes in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[ 186 ]</a></span>
collapsed state with the spider at the bottom. In
one case, on opening the box in which the nest was
placed, he perceived a movement throughout the tube,
as if it were being inflated; this however soon subsided,
but the following morning he was surprised to
see that the whole tube was inflated, especially at the
end which had lain exposed on the bank. He failed
to find any aperture by which the spider could enter
or leave her nest, and his captives, though passing
backwards and forwards in their tubes, never came
out at either end. He never saw flies or any fragments
of insects in the nests; but, on drawing out one of
the tubes, he observed a worm at the lower end, partially
within it, partially outside, and he perceived
that the spider had evidently been eating a considerable
portion of its anterior extremity.</p>

<p>It will readily be seen that there are some discrepancies
between the different accounts which have
been given of the nests of <i>Atypus</i> found in England
and France,<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> and I think it quite probable that some
at least of the nests described may really differ, and
be the work of distinct species belonging to this
genus. Mr. Brown describes his nests as having by
far the greater part of their length under ground,
while in those observed by M. Simon, as shown in
my figure, <a href="#Plate_XIII">Plate XIII</a> fig. A, the exposed portion of
the tube equalled or exceeded the subterranean.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_127" id="Footnote_127"></a><a href="#FNanchor_127"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> A subject already alluded to in <i>Ants and Spiders</i>, at p. 78.</p></div>

<p>An imperfect specimen at the British Museum,
from some English station (exact habitat not given),
appears to have the proportions described by Mr.
Brown; the length of the a&euml;rial portion of the tube
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[ 187 ]</a></span>
being less than one-fourth of that of the subterranean;
the upper end of the tube is however open, but I am
doubtful whether this was originally so or not, for
the silk is torn at this point, and the opening may be
a rent caused by rough handling.</p>

<p>After a comparison of the above description, it
appears to me that the following are the principal
points which remain to be cleared up:</p>

<p>1. What is the precise structure of the nests of
Atypus, and are they always uniform in character at
all seasons of the year?</p>

<p>2. What is the use of the exposed a&euml;rial portion
of the tube?</p>

<p>3. Do the two British species make similar nests?</p>

<p>4. What food, besides worms, does the female live
upon, and how does she obtain it?</p>

<p>5. Does she ever leave the nest?</p>

<p>6. What becomes of these spiders and their nests
in the winter, and how long do they live?</p>

<p>7. When do the young leave the nest; and do they,
like their relatives in the South, construct nests like
those of their parents in miniature?</p>

<p>I would commend all these points to any lover
of Nature who may seek the southern coasts of
England during the autumn and winter months,
and I think it more than likely that a careful search
in the sandy banks near St. Leonards, the slopes
under the fir-woods of Bournemouth, and the deep
lanes in the neighbourhood of Torquay, would be
rewarded with success.</p>

<p>If the breeding season in England only commences
in October, as appears to be the case in France, it
would seem most probable that the spiders survive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[ 188 ]</a></span>
the winter. Very possibly these spiders and their
nests might be transplanted and placed for observation
in a garden; and if room were granted them in
a greenhouse or Wardian case, or even in a large
flower-pot in a living-room, it is not unlikely that
the warmer temperature might waken them up to
renewed activity.</p>

<p>It seems clear that <i>Atypus</i> has to fear the insidious
attacks of enemies; for not only is the external portion
of the tube closed or almost closed at certain seasons,
but it is covered outside with such materials as may
serve to make it resemble the surrounding surface of
the ground. Thus Mr. Brown's nests, lying on a
sandy bank, were covered with particles of sand, while
my specimen from Troyes has moss and fibres of plants
woven into its upper extremity.</p>

<p>Indeed, all the European representatives of the suborder
<i>Territelari&aelig;</i> which I have myself met with,
conceal their nests with great care and skill. There
appear to be others, however, which either make no
nests at all but hide under stones, or only construct
a simple silk tube, open at the mouth, and without any
special contrivance for its dissimulation. Further
observation of the habits and dwellings of these apparently
unworthy members of the trap-door group
is much to be desired.</p>

<p>Mr. Bates,<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> in his work on the Amazons, describes
<i>Mygale (Theraphosa) Blondii</i>, a large and powerful
spider of that region, as burrowing into the earth
and "forming a broad slanting gallery about three
feet long, the sides of which he lines beautifully with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[ 189 ]</a></span>
silk." This spider "is nocturnal in his habits," and
maybe seen "just before sunset keeping watch within
the mouth of his tunnel, disappearing suddenly when
he hears a heavy foot-tread near his hiding place."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_128" id="Footnote_128"></a><a href="#FNanchor_128"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> Bates, H. W., <i>Naturalist on the Amazons</i>, Ed. 2. (1864).</p></div>

<p>This nest would therefore appear to have an open
tube undefended by any door; but in this case the
great size of the spider and the depth of the burrow,
which is more than twice as long as that of the
average European nests, may help to explain this
apparent want of precaution.</p>

<p>But, if we wish to learn with what different materials
and by what varied means the same end of self-preservation
can be attained, we have only to cast a
glance at the sketch of a portion of a nest at fig. B,
<a href="#Plate_XIII">Plate XIII</a>, p. 183, where it will be seen that the
entrance to the nest, far from being concealed or
obscured in any way, is rendered a most striking
object, and one which appears devised for the very
purpose of attracting attention. The nest to which I
refer is the work of <i>Cyrtauchenius elongatus</i>, from Morocco,
and consists, according to the account given me
by its discoverer, M. Simon, of a deep cylindrical
burrow in the soil, the silk lining of which is prolonged
upwards for about three inches above the surface of
the ground, and enlarged into a funnel shape, so that
it becomes from two to three inches across at the
orifice. This a&euml;rial portion being snow-white, at once
attracts the eye even from a considerable distance, and
the nests rising up amid the sparse grasses and other
small plants which serve to support but not to conceal
them, present the appearance of scattered white fungi.</p>

<p>This is therefore quite a new type among the nests
constructed by trap-door spiders, new in form and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[ 190 ]</a></span>
probably in function also, and I would propose to
distinguish it provisionally as the <i>funnel type</i>.</p>

<p>Now the female <i>Cyrtauchenius</i> is, like its near relatives
the <i>Nemesias</i>, a sluggish and rather helpless
creature, and shows no apparent physical superiority
which might countenance its dispensing with the
methods of concealment which form the characteristic
habit of the group.</p>

<p>How then does this spider manage to escape its
many enemies, especially the insidious attacks of
the insects of the <i>Sphex</i> and <i>Ichneumon</i> families, which
certainly abound in Morocco?</p>

<p>Mr. Wallace, to whom I put the question, suggested
that this species may perhaps be chiefly nocturnal in
its habits, and that, if this is the case, the bright
white and flower-like tube of the nest may possibly
serve to attract night flying insects, which would thus
become its prey.</p>

<p>In any case, whether we can discover them or not,
some curious points of difference must exist between
this spider and its allies, which secure to it a comparative
immunity.</p>

<p>It appears to me that there are few questions
which can be of greater interest to the naturalist
than those which have to do with the conditions determining
the existence of a given species in a given
place.</p>

<p>Of the questions, Who are your relatives? Where
do they live? and How are you able to live here?
surely the last is not the least important.</p>

<p>And, if we wish to try to answer this question, we
must do all in our power to find out how the habits
and conditions of life of the creature in question,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[ 191 ]</a></span>
differ from those of its competitors; for we may be
quite certain that it does not exist where we see it
by grace and favour, but by merit; if it is neither
stronger, cleverer nor more numerous than its neighbours,
we may be sure that it has found some means
of living which does not interfere fatally with their
requirements. Hence the endless diversity of function
and habits in all living creatures, which forms such a
prolific and marvellous subject for our study and contemplation.</p>

<p>I am indebted to M. Simon for permission to
publish the details given above on <i>Cyrtauchenius
elongatus</i>, and also for having given me such directions
as enabled me to make the sketch from which the
drawing at <a href="#Plate_XIII">Plate XIII</a>, fig. B, was copied.</p>

<p>I must however state that this illustration is not
taken from an actual specimen, but is prepared solely
from his description; so that it cannot pretend to
complete accuracy of detail. M. Simon assured me
nevertheless that it conveyed the general appearance
of this remarkable nest with sufficient fidelity, and I
have been induced to reproduce it here in the hope
that it may serve to make my meaning plainer, and to
suggest the kind of object which one should look
for, if an opportunity offered.</p>

<p>Another species of the same genus, <i>Cyrtauchenius
Doleschallii</i>, is known to inhabit Sicily, but the nest is
undescribed. M. Lucas has described two species,<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
belonging to the closely-allied genus <i>Cyrtocephalus</i>,
both of which appear to construct nests somewhat
similar in form to that discovered by M. Simon.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[ 192 ]</a></span>
Whether these nests are equally showy we cannot
tell, as the account is brief and few details are given;
but one, that of <i>Cyrtocephalus terricola</i>, appears to
differ in having threads stretched from the opening
of its funnel, which serve to ensnare insects and to
give notice of these captures.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_129" id="Footnote_129"></a><a href="#FNanchor_129"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> <i>Cyrtocephalus Walckena&euml;ri</i> and <i>terricola</i>, Lucas (H.), <i>Animaux articul&eacute;s
de l'Alg&eacute;rie</i> (Paris, 1847-9), vol. i. p. 94-5.</p></div>

<p>The great trap-door group therefore comprises
spiders which differ widely in respect of their dwelling
places. Some construct no nest at all or only an
irregular web, and live under stones; others, like
<i>Theraphosa Blondii</i>, make a simple cylindrical tunnel,
or, like those just described, a tube having a prolonged,
uncovered, funnel-shaped mouth: others
again, belonging to the genus <i>Atypus</i>, form the
curious and as yet imperfectly-understood nests with a
silken tubular lining, part of which hangs down outside;
while on the highest rung of the architectural
ladder, stand the builders of the veritable trap-door
nests.</p>

<p>It seems quite possible that, when we know more
of the structures made by <i>Territelari&aelig;</i> generally in
various parts of the world, we shall find that nests of
various degrees of complexity and perfection of
structure exist, bridging over the gulf between the
barbarous dwellers under stones and the highly civilized
inhabitants of the branched wafer and cork
nests.</p>

<p>Indeed, thanks to recent discoveries, I am already
able to do something of this kind for one small group
of spiders, namely, for that of the European <i>Nemesias</i>
having nests with wafer doors.</p>


<div id="Plate_XIV" class="fig_center" style="width: 601px;">
<div class="fig_caption"><i>Plate XIV.</i></div>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[ 193 ]</a></span></p>

<p>I hope to make this plain by reference to the
diagrams on <a href="#Plate_XIV">Plate XIV</a>, where the figures C, D, E, F,
and G represent on a reduced scale five types of wafer
nest constructed by as many distinct spiders, and
where a gradation may readily be traced between the
simplest type at C and the most complicated at G; but
we shall speak more fully of this matter by-and-by.</p>

<p>In these diagrams I have placed that representing
the nest of <i>Atypus</i> on the extreme left (A);<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> next to
this stands that of a nest of the cork type (B), a
type which must be carefully distinguished from all
the rest. It must not be supposed that the solid
cork door (so called from its resemblance to a short
cork closing the neck of a bottle), is nothing more
than a thicker edition of the wafer door; it is not so,
but, on the contrary, possesses a very characteristic
structure of its own, being composed of many layers
of silk, each furnished with a sloping rim of earth,
while the wafer door consists of but a single layer of
silk.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_130" id="Footnote_130"></a><a href="#FNanchor_130"><span class="label">[23]</span></a>
 These types may be briefly enumerated as follows:</p>

<table summary="data">

<p>I have represented at B 1 the 14 layers of silk
and earth which went to make a single cork door
examined by me. It will be seen that the outermost
of these layers is the largest, and the innermost the
smallest, and I have already (<i>Ants and Spiders</i>, p. 150)
shown reason for believing that the latter constituted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[ 194 ]</a></span>
the first door the spider ever made, and that the consecutive
layers mark successive stages in the enlargement
of the nest.</p>

<p>There is therefore a broad distinction as to construction
between cork nests and wafer nests; moreover,
while the former are, as far as we know at
present, all of one type, and only differ in size or
proportion, the latter appear under five distinct types.</p>

<p>Thus, every known cork nest, whether found in
Europe, America, or the Antipodes, has the same
solid door and simple tube; while of the wafer nests,
some have branched and others simple tubes, and
some again possess a lower door in addition to the
upper or surface door.</p>

<p>In the following pages I intend to treat of the
trap-door spiders and their nests in the same order in
which the latter are placed in the diagram, commencing
with those of the cork type B, and then
dealing successively with the several wafer nests from
C to G. We have already spoken of A, the nest of
<i>Atypus piceus</i>, and seen that our present knowledge of
this nest, of the habits of its occupant and of those of
its relations, is still far from complete.</p>

<p>The cork type is, as my readers will perhaps remember,
the great cosmopolitan type which ranges
round the world, and which, curious to say, is built by
many different spiders belonging to distinct genera.</p>

<p>The idea of planning this very perfect bit of mechanism
appears to be the common inheritance of
these several spiders, separated though they are by
wide intervals of geographical space as well as to
structural divergence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[ 195 ]</a></span></p>

<p>At Mentone two distinct spiders construct nests of
the cork type, one of these being a <i>Nemesia</i> and the
other a <i>Cteniza</i>. They are as unlike each other as
they well can be, and it seems remarkably strange
that their nest-building instinct should be so similar.
The nest of the <i>Cteniza</i> is indeed shallower than that
of the <i>Nemesia</i>, and a practised eye can usually trace
a difference between the slightly less angular lower
surface and more semi-circular outline of the door of
the former, and the more abruptly bevelled and more
circular door of the latter.</p>

<p>These spiders and their nests have been already
described and figured in <i>Ants and Spiders</i> under the
names of <i>Ct. fodiens</i> and <i>Nemesia c&aelig;mentaria</i>. Recent
discoveries have however shown that these spiders
possess distinctive characters of their own, and, though
closely allied to the species indicated, should be separated
from them.</p>

<p>Last spring when pulling down an old terrace-wall
(by permission) I had the good fortune to discover
the very remarkable male <i>Cteniza</i> drawn at fig. A,
<a href="#Plate_XX">Pl. XX</a>, p. 254. I found no trace of a nest or web of
any kind, and the spider was merely hiding between
the stones.</p>

<p>There appears to be scarcely any doubt that this is
the male of the female Mentonese <i>Cteniza</i> which has,
up to this time, been called <i>Ct. fodiens</i>. A comparison
with typical specimens of the true <i>Ct. fodiens</i> from
Corsica, has however shown that the two are certainly
distinct, and Mr. Pickard-Cambridge<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[ 196 ]</a></span>
describes the Mentonese form under the name of <i>Ct.
Moggridgii</i>.<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_131" id="Footnote_131"></a><a href="#FNanchor_131"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> Mr. Pickard-Cambridge has once more kindly undertaken the task of
naming and describing my collections of trap-door spiders, and the results of
his labours will be found at the end of the present work.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_132" id="Footnote_132"></a><a href="#FNanchor_132"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> I take this opportunity of thanking him for the compliment. A description
of this new species will be found at p. 254, below.</p></div>

<p>The females of the true <i>Cteniza fodiens</i> are far larger
than those of our new Mentonese species, and construct
their nests in dry and exposed places, instead
of in the moist and shady ivy-covered banks selected
by the latter. I have found <i>Cteniza Moggridgii</i> at
San Remo and Mentone, and it will probably be also
discovered at Nice, but I failed to detect it either at
Cannes or Hy&egrave;res.</p>

<p>The Corsican male at the first glance curiously resembles
that found at Mentone, but differs essentially
in details and especially in having the surface of
the caput unbroken, whereas the caput of the
latter presents a very peculiar character in an
impressed line which runs across it from side to side
(figs. A 1 and A 2). Both agree, however, in being
strangely unlike their females.</p>

<p>The other builder of a nest of the cork type at
Mentone was, as has been already stated, described
and figured in <i>Ants and Spiders</i> under the name of
<i>Nemesia c&aelig;mentaria</i>. Now the true <i>N. c&aelig;mentaria</i> of
Latreille is found at Montpellier, the classical habitat
where the first discovery of trap-door spiders in
Europe was made towards the end of the last century,
but its true characters have been hitherto but imperfectly
known.</p>

<p>I have lately been able to secure several specimens
at this place, and they certainly differed in their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[ 197 ]</a></span>
markings from the so-called <i>c&aelig;mentaria</i> of Mentone.
M. Simon had previously informed me that he considered
our Mentonese spider distinct from the typical
<i>c&aelig;mentaria</i>, and had kindly proposed to give my
name to the Mentonese species; and now Mr. Pickard-Cambridge,
on the receipt of the specimens collected
by me at Montpellier, coincides with M. Simon, and
adopts his nomenclature, calling the Mentonese
<i>Nemesia N. Moggridgii</i>.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_133" id="Footnote_133"></a><a href="#FNanchor_133"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> See below, p. 273.</p></div>

<p>I found but one nest of the cork type at Montpellier,
where it was most abundant, and invariably
inhabited by the same spider, so that there can be
little doubt that this is the celebrated <i>Nemesia c&aelig;mentaria</i>
of Latreille, the nests of which were described
by the Abb&eacute; Sauvages in 1763.</p>

<p>When living, the pattern on the abdomen is far
more distinct and is traced on a paler ground than in
<i>N. Moggridgii</i>, and the patterns on the back of the
caput, as seen in specimens preserved in spirits, and
the relative sizes of the lateral eyes, as well as other
details enumerated by Mr. Pickard-Cambridge, afford
characters by which they may be known apart; and
it is probable that when the males, which are at
present unknown, shall be discovered, they will be
found to present other distinctive peculiarities. In
the present instance we have the reverse of the
case described above, in which two very distinct
spiders constructed a similar nest, for here both
spiders and nests are much alike.</p>

<p>We have yet to learn what are the special advantages
which each type of nest affords; but it is plain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[ 198 ]</a></span>
from the fact of the same type being adopted indifferently
by both nearly- and most distantly-related
spiders, that the form of the nest is governed far
more by the conditions which it is contrived to meet,
than by the affinity or resemblance of the spiders
which construct it.</p>

<p>I have found <i>N. Moggridgii</i> at San Remo, Mentone,
Cannes, Hy&egrave;res, and Marseilles, but thus far, I only
know of the true <i>N. c&aelig;mentaria</i> at Montpellier.</p>

<p>The latter spider is rather bolder than the former,
and I frequently saw it at Montpellier watching at
the slightly raised door, with the tips of the claws
projecting from the nest, and it rarely failed to
resist most vigorously any attempt of mine to force
the door open.</p>

<p>During the summer of 1873, I received two specimens
of trap-door nests from California. Both of
these nests were of the cork type and nearly entire,
wanting only a small portion of the base of the tube;
they most closely resembled one another and were
probably the work of the same spider. For one
of these, coming from the San Joaquin valley,
between the Calaveras and the Tejon, I have to
thank M. J. C. Puls, a Belgian entomologist residing
at Ghent; and for the other, containing the spider
which had constructed it <i>alive within its tube</i> (!), I
am indebted to Mr. G. H. Treadwell of San Francisco.
The former nest is drawn at fig. A, <a href="#Plate_XV">Plate XV</a>, and
the spider<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> from the latter at fig. B of the same
plate.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_134" id="Footnote_134"></a><a href="#FNanchor_134"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> This spider, which proves to be a new species, is described below (p. 260) as
<i>Cteniza Californica</i>.</p></div>


<div id="Plate_XV" class="fig_center" style="width: 364px;">
<div class="fig_caption"><i>Plate XV.</i></div>
<a href="images/plate15lg.png"><img src="images/plate15.png" width="364" height="608" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[ 199 ]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Treadwell had carried this spider and its nest,
with the block of earth in which it lay, all the way
from Visalia, a town about 350 miles south of San
Francisco, where he had taken it; the nest and spider
travelled safe to London enclosed in an empty cocoatina
tin, 4<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inches deep, and 2<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> across.</p>

<p>The nest was then entire, for these spiders appear
to make singularly shallow tubes; and it might have
remained so up to the present day had it not been
for the rash curiosity of a chambermaid in the London
hotel where Mr. Treadwell was staying, who, smitten
with a great desire to learn what the heavy little box
which came from the land of gold might contain,
proceeded to examine the earth, when the sudden
appearance of the spider frightened her so much that
box and nest and all were thrown with a crash upon
the floor.</p>

<p>Were it not for this unlucky incident I might have
seen a complete specimen of this curious nest; but as
it was, though the spider miraculously escaped uninjured,
the bottom of the nest was pounded into dust,
and only the upper portion remained intact.</p>

<p>Both this nest and that sent to me by M. Puls,
were of the true cork type, and presented a solid door
with a bevelled edge, fitting into the correspondingly
bevelled lip of the tube, and shutting flush with
the surface of the ground. The lining of the tube
was strong and thick, but soft and silky to the
touch.</p>

<p>The tube itself in Mr. Treadwell's specimen, when
intact, cannot have measured more than 3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inches in
length; and we learn from Dr. Lanzwert, who collected
the other specimen, that the average length of
these nests does not exceed three inches. Dr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[ 200 ]</a></span>
Lanzwert, writing in one of the local papers<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> of "The
Mygales or Ground Spiders," says, "the poisonous
black tarantulas, so well known to naturalists, are
extremely common in California, but only in places
upland, or lowland which are very hot and dry.
Their principal haunts are the San Joaquin valley,
between the Calaveras and the Tejon. A similar
species from the coast is not only smaller than the interior
variety, but the colours are much deeper.
They both make a curious habitation under the
ground, composed of a glutinized, web-worked purse,
about three inches long, and which is furnished with
a tightly-fitting lid which they can open or shut at
pleasure, and which is as cunning a piece of insect
architecture as is to be found in nature. These ugly
loathsome Californian spiders are often mentioned by
thoughtless scribes as carrying no more danger than
a common wasp, like the species of Italy, but it is
well known that several persons, young and old, have
lost their lives in this State from the bite of such
tarantulas as are met with in our coast and interior
country. Their enemy in the Tulare valley is an
immense shining black wasp,<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> fully an inch long,
which will pounce upon them, and after a short
battle drag the tarantula along in the most valiant
style of heroic conquest. These interior tarantulas
are often seen measuring two inches in the
spread."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_136" id="Footnote_136"></a><a href="#FNanchor_136"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> This insect was probably not a true wasp, though belonging to an allied
family; it may perhaps have been a <i>Pepsis</i>, certain species of which genus
Mr. Bates informs me he has frequently seen near Santarem on the Amazon,
hawking over the ground where the huge trap-door spiders lived, and suddenly
pouncing down upon one of these creatures, often many times larger than
themselves, when, after paralysing their victim with their sting, they would
deliberately saw off the legs before dragging away the bodies!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[ 201 ]</a></span></p></div>

<p>Mr. Treadwell was quite as much impressed as Dr.
Lanzwert with the belief that the bite of these spiders
is fatal, but it does not appear that either of these
gentlemen have obtained conclusive evidence in support
of this allegation.</p>

<p>I have occasionally been bitten by the trap-door
spiders in South France, but have never experienced
the slightest subsequent inconvenience, nor was
there any trace of inflammation or poisoning about
the punctures which they made. Mr. Blackwall<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>
has made a very careful set of observations on this
head, and has caused some of the largest species of
British spiders to bite his finger and wrist until the
blood flowed, without the slightest ill effects. He also
inoculated himself at the same time with the poisonous
secretion of the spider and with that of the wasp;
when the latter wound became extremely painful,
while the former was not perceptibly aggravated.
Mr. Blackwall obtained the spiders' poison by causing
a spider to seize a slip of clean glass with its mandibles,
when a small quantity of a liquid showing a slightly
acid reaction was deposited.</p>

<div class="footnote">

Poison of the Araneidea," pp. 240-256.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Treadwell informed me that these Californian
trap-door spiders leave their nests in the daytime,
and may be seen walking by the roadside, though
they are always prepared to hurry back to their nests
on the approach of danger.</p>

<p>I received the spider which I have represented at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[ 202 ]</a></span>
fig. B, <a href="#Plate_XV">Pl. XV</a>, p. 198 (<i>Cteniza Californica</i>), from this
gentleman alive, and still within the remaining portion
of her nest, on the 6th of July, 1873. She then had
the legs and cephalothorax of a brownish-black, and
the abdomen of a dull, uniform, dusky chocolate brown,
but with an indistinct median line near the anterior end
on the upper side, intersected at right angles by a
shorter line. Mr. Treadwell said, however, that when
captured, this spider was much darker, and of a pitchy
black colour. The hairs all over the body were short,
but especially so on the abdomen, which had the appearance
of cloth or felt.</p>

<p>This creature in many ways recalls <i>Cteniza fodiens</i>
of Corsica, and in a less degree the <i>Cteniza</i> of Mentone
and San Remo.</p>

<p>We find not only the same general form of body,
but also the same claws furnished with only one
tooth, instead of many as in <i>Nemesia</i>, and other
distinctive features; and it is interesting to observe
in the nest that the more semi-circular form of the
door and the wider hinge also connect it rather with
<i>Cteniza</i> than with <i>Nemesia</i>.</p>

<p>Here, as in all spiders yet observed in cork nests,
we find the habit of resisting any attempt to open the
door, and many a time when I have wished to raise
the lid in order to drop in flies or other food, I have
been obliged to desist because the bending blade of
my penknife showed that I should injure the nest if
I used greater force.</p>

<p>No doubt the shallowness of the nest is an advantage
to its occupant in one way&mdash;namely, that it
enables the spider to start up at the shortest notice,
and cling on to the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[ 203 ]</a></span></p>

<p>It is curious to find that, far as California is removed
from the Riviera, the same habits of construction and
self-defence are common to the spiders of both countries,
and that the bond of kinship sets time and space
at defiance.</p>

<p>I kept this spider all through the summer and early
autumn at Richmond (Surrey), sprinkling the nest
from time to time with water, and constantly supplying
its inhabitant with flies, wood-lice, grasshoppers,
earwigs, and other similar dainties. She did not,
however, seem eager for food, and the insects provided
for her, and actually placed within the nest, were
often turned out again almost untouched.</p>

<p>When I placed living insects, such as grasshoppers,
for example, within the nest over-night, she would
often allow them to remain there unharmed, so that
I found them ready to escape on opening the door
the following morning.</p>

<p>I never saw her leave the nest of her own free
will, and when I made her come out and set her to
run in the garden, she began at once to seek for a
place to hide in, hobbling along in an ungainly way
and at a slow pace.</p>

<p>She must, however, have left the nest on more
than one occasion, unseen by me, for she deposited
several clusters of eggs at various times upon the
under-surface of the gauze net which was fastened over
the mouth of the box in which she was imprisoned.</p>

<p>The first of these groups of eggs was laid during
the night between the 12th and 13th of July, and
formed a raspberry-shaped cluster attached to the gauze.</p>

<p>I have represented this cluster of the natural size
at fig. B, 6, and magnified at fig. B, 7, on <a href="#Plate_XV">Plate XV</a>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[ 204 ]</a></span>
only in an inverted position, for they really hung
downwards from the under side of the net.</p>

<p>These eggs were greyish white or pale brown, and
varied in shape from globose to oblong.</p>

<p>All were very small, the largest only measuring <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>
line in its greatest length, but it is doubtful whether
any of these eggs were fertile, and, though they
appeared full and plump, many presented an irregular
and fissured surface.</p>

<p>A fortnight later (July 27) another cluster of eggs
was laid, and this time between the hours of five and
eight <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> When the lamp was brought in at the
latter hour, I perceived what I took to be a drop of
water hanging from the gauze cover above and rather
in front of the spider's door, the very position occupied
by the cluster of eggs previously described.
On closer inspection this proved to be a drop of a
pellucid colourless liquid, in which some thirty eggs
floated. One egg was laid on the gauze at some
distance from the main group, and several were also
attached to the inside of the tin box.</p>

<p>At midnight I found that the drop had coagulated
and contracted, and by the following morning the
mass was quite dry and resembled the former group,
only that it was not quite so convex.</p>

<p>Some of the eggs forming this cluster were much
larger than any in the preceding one, and one
measured as much as a line in length by half a line
in breadth. This group is shown magnified at fig. B, 8,
<a href="#Plate_XV">Plate XV</a>, and some of the separate eggs more highly
magnified at fig. B, 9.</p>

<p>Between this date and the end of November when
the spider died, eggs were laid on seven distinct occasions&mdash;viz.,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[ 205 ]</a></span>
on July 31, August 11, 15, 31 (when I
again found the eggs floating in a drop of liquid,
having been deposited on the gauze between two and
half-past four o'clock in the afternoon); September 9
(23 eggs laid on the earth near the entrance to the
nest); September 19 (about 30 eggs on the gauze), and
November 4 (about 30 eggs on the gauze).</p>

<p>Thus, between July 13 and November 4, this
spider laid nine clusters of eggs, all but one of which
were placed on the same part of the gauze cover,
above and a little in front of the door, and the total
number of eggs deposited cannot have been less than
250. It is difficult to understand why she should
have laid these eggs outside the nest, unless indeed
she knew them to be sterile, and so treated them as
refuse. I can scarcely believe that such a procedure
is in accordance with the ordinary habits of these
spiders; for, if the eggs and young are habitually
exposed, then the perfect concealment of the nest
would lose one of its most important uses. When we
remember that there are minute hymenopterous
insects which lay their eggs within the eggs of the
spiders, we can see how important it may be that the
entrance to a nest, which is at once nursery and
stronghold, should be closed by a well-fitting door,
and one which may exclude, not only the larger and
more powerful enemies of the full-grown spiders, but
also the tiny and almost imperceptible assailants of
the eggs and young.</p>

<p>This Californian spider was always careful to eject
from the nest the remains of insects with which I
had supplied her, and, as she did so deliberately and
by day as well as by night, I had frequent opportunities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[ 206 ]</a></span>
of watching her. Sometimes, if not alarmed
by any sudden movement, she would remain for one
or two minutes at the mouth of the nest with the
door partly raised, and I was glad to seize these
opportunities for making some experiments, with a
view to learning whether she would prove as sensitive
to sound as she did to other vibrations and to the
sight of moving objects.</p>

<p>Placing myself so that the partly-opened door
screened me from her view, I was able to approach
close to the nest without causing her alarm, and to
make different sounds and noises at distances varying
from three to fourteen inches.</p>

<p>In no case, however, did she pay the slightest
attention; and neither shrill and sudden whistling,
deep chest and buzzing sounds, an octave of piercing
notes struck upon brass bells, my best imitation of
the whirring of the fern owl, or finally, the angry
hum of a large humble-bee imprisoned in a paper
box, and held within three inches of the door of the
nest, appeared to produce any kind of effect. This
surprised me, I confess, for, though I am aware that
no auditory apparatus has as yet been discovered in
spiders, I can scarcely believe that they stand at so
great a disadvantage as creatures would seem to do
which lack the power of hearing.</p>

<p>These experiments must not, however, be taken
for more than they are worth; and the results
obtained may have been due rather to apathy in the
individual spider than to a want of perception in
the race generally. In any case they suggest the
need of further experiment and observation in this
direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[ 207 ]</a></span></p>

<p>In October I carried this Californian spider out
with me to Mentone, and she lived there and appeared
plump and well until the end of the following month,
when she suddenly died, having laid one more group
of eggs in the interval. On examination, I found a
dark brown spot on one side of the abdomen, and
this, I think, probably indicates that her death was
caused by some insect of the ichneumon family,
which had laid its eggs within the spider's body,
after having stabbed it at the place indicated by the
discolouration.</p>

<p>Not very long before this melancholy event occurred,
I had put the spider to some inconvenience
in order to secure her portrait from life, to effect
which I took her from her nest and placed her in a
deep china saucer.</p>

<p>She exhibited the strongest dislike to exposure,
and sought to hide herself even under a fold of
blotting-paper which lay in the saucer with her. I
also noted that she appeared quite incapable of walking
up the sides of the saucer, and it would therefore
seem that she was destitute of the viscid hairs which
enable some spiders to traverse glazed and polished
surfaces.</p>

<p>Seeing this anxiety on the part of the spider for
concealment, it came into my mind that, perhaps, if
she were placed on the surface of a pot full of garden
mould she might excavate a tunnel in order to hide
herself from view. This I accordingly did in the
evening of November 15, and on the following morning
I was delighted to find that she had commenced
to dig and was still at work.</p>

<p>In little more than an hour's time the hollow had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[ 208 ]</a></span>
become about the size of half a walnut, and resembled
in its nearly semi-circular outline and size the surface
of the door of her own nest. I was greatly pleased
to be able to watch the creature at the work of excavation,
a sight which I believe no naturalist has ever
had before.</p>

<p>The legs took no part in the digging, and the palpi
were but little used, the mandibles and their fangs
being the implements chiefly employed. As soon as
a little earth had been loosened and gathered up, the
spider walked up to the edge of her excavation and
deposited there her mouthful of particles of earth,
separating and working the mandibles up and down
in the effort to part with the pellet, which had been
carried between the fangs and the mouth-organs.
Each pellet was very small, and the operation appeared
to be excessively tedious and laborious. I
had expected to see the spider scrape out large quantities
of earth at a time, and either drag it backwards
or kick it out behind her as a terrier does when
working at a rabbit-burrow; but no, every little
pellet removed was carried forwards, and deposited
separately on the "tip."</p>

<p>On the two following days, the 17th and 18th
November, the spider remained almost inactive, and
brooded over the cavity she had made, and which
still remained too shallow to conceal or even contain
her. At 4 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> on the latter day I made a hole for
her in the earth, and, after some indecision, she took
possession of it. Next day, however, finding that she
remained motionless in the hole which I had made,
and displayed no apparent intention of either lining
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[ 209 ]</a></span>
it with silk or furnishing it with a door, I replaced
her in her own nest.</p>

<p>Within a few days after this date I found her dead
at the bottom of her tube, and at first I was inclined
to fear that the treatment to which she had lately
been subjected might have caused her end. When,
however, I detected the brown spot on the side of the
abdomen, described above, and which so strongly recalled
the marks frequently observable in caterpillars
attacked by ichneumons, I came to the conclusion
that she had really died from the internal injuries
caused by the gnawing of these cruel parasites; and
that the eggs, laid long before by one of these insects,
had been hatched within her body and developed
into larv&aelig;, which, living upon her tissues, had at
length destroyed some vital part. It is surprising
that a creature, carrying within itself such a fatal
brood, should not only live, but be capable of undergoing
such adventures and misadventures as this
travelled spider endured with seeming indifference;
but similar facts are familiar to all those who have
attended to the rearing of caterpillars, and the
frequent disappointment caused by the death of apparently
sound specimens which have been attacked
in this way is but too well known.</p>

<p>It would appear that <i>Cteniza Californica</i> is peculiarly
amenable to captivity, and indeed to captivity
of the strictest kind.</p>

<p>My specimen lived during all the time she was in
my possession in a cocoatina tin, a cylindrical box
4<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> in. deep and 2<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> in. in diameter, which always
stood among the books and papers on my writing-table.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[ 210 ]</a></span>
It is probable that those trap-door spiders
which inhabit nests with short tubes, and which
therefore can be transported nest and all, would be
less disconcerted by imprisonment than is the case
with other kinds living at the bottom of a long
burrow which it is almost impossible to carry away
entire. This is borne out by what has been related
(<i>Ants and Spiders</i>, p. 122) of the habits of <i>Cteniza
ionica</i> in captivity, which not only endured to have
its nest set upside down in a flower-pot, but actually
furnished the inverted base of the tube with a door
appropriate to its new position.</p>

<p>Canon Tristram (the well-known author and naturalist)
was so kind as to send me two trap-door
nests from Palestine for inspection; these were small
cork nests, the doors of which resembled those of the
Mentonese <i>Cteniza</i> (<i>Ct. Moggridgii</i>), but the tubes
were exceedingly short, and that of the more perfect
specimen, as I gather from Canon Tristram, measured
only two inches and an eighth in length when
entire.</p>

<p>The nests of <i>Cteniza ionica</i> are but little longer,
and that of the Mentonese <i>Cteniza</i>, though never so
shallow as these, are far less deep than those of
<i>Nemesia c&aelig;mentaria</i>, the builder of the typical cork
nest.</p>

<p>And now we will leave the nests of the cork type
and their inhabitants, and turn to the more intricate
group of nests belonging to the wafer type. Following
the order indicated in the diagrams, we will begin
with the simplest type of all, fig. C, and afterwards
take the remaining types one after the other, advancing
until we reach the most complex type, G.
The nest represented diagrammatically at fig. C, in
<a href="#Plate_XV">Plate XIV</a>, is shown of the natural size in Plate XVI.,
with the spider (<i>Nemesia Simoni</i>, Camb.) which constructs
it (fig. A 1).</p>


<div id="Plate_XVI" class="fig_center" style="width: 354px;">
<div class="fig_caption"><i>Plate XVI.</i></div>
<a href="images/plate16lg.png"><img src="images/plate16.png" width="354" height="641" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[ 211 ]</a></span></p>

<p>It belongs to the single-door unbranched wafer
type, of which one example has already been described
in the West Indian nest (see <i>Ants and Spiders</i>, p. 79,
fig. B in woodcut); for, though this latter has a shorter
tube and a much stouter silk lining than is the case
with its European representative, there does not
appear to be sufficient difference to justify their separation
as distinct types.</p>

<p>This, which is the simplest known form of trap-door
nest, is quite new to Europe, and the spider
inhabiting it proves also to be one hitherto undescribed;
it has received from Mr. Pickard-Cambridge,
the name of <i>Nemesia Simoni</i>,<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> being so called in
honour of M. E. Simon, the well-known arachnologist.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_138" id="Footnote_138"></a><a href="#FNanchor_138"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> Mr. Pickard-Cambridge describes <i>N. Simoni</i> at p. 297 below. This
species is remarkably well characterized, an assertion rarely to be made in the
case of those <i>Nemesias</i> of which, as in the present instance, the female only is
known. The elevated, rounded, and glabrous caput at once distinguishes it,
not to speak of other peculiarities. Mr. Pickard-Cambridge alludes to the
presence, in the specimens forwarded to him in spirits, of two singular indentations
on either side of the caput (fig. A 3, <a href="#Plate_XVI">Plate XVI</a>). I did not observe this
when these spiders were alive, but I remember that the caput of one of these
spiders which had been injured in capture contracted and expanded spasmodically,
presenting a painful resemblance to laboured breathing. I have not
observed this in other spiders.</p></div>

<p>During last May (1874) we spent a few days at
Bordeaux on our homeward route. While there my
sister was fortunate enough to discover a single nest
of this type when we were out together on a spider-hunt
near the little village of Lormont, which is
situated on the opposite bank of the river to that on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[ 212 ]</a></span>
which the city stands. We subsequently found these
nests in tolerable abundance in a deep shady lane near
a restaurant called Mon R&eacute;pos, on the same side of
the river, but rather farther up.</p>

<p>Here the hedge banks were high, and the soil was
composed of a fine even-grained loam of great depth,
which permitted the spiders to carry their tubes very
far down, some of them attaining a length of 15
inches.</p>

<p>This made it very difficult to follow them throughout
their whole course and so to assure oneself of the
real structure of the nests, but I succeeded in doing
this in twelve instances.</p>

<p>In every one of these I found the tube cylindrical
and unbranched throughout, and destitute of any
trace of a lower door.</p>

<p>This deficiency alone distinguishes the present type
from that to which the nest of <i>Nemesia Eleanora</i>
belongs; the latter being of the <i>double-door</i> and the
former of the <i>single-door, unbranched wafer type</i>.</p>

<p>But perhaps it may be asked whether it is safe to
assume that because twelve examples of this nest
were found to correspond in structure, and were
tenanted by the same occupant, that therefore all the
Bordeaux nests in which this particular spider might
be found would present similar peculiarities.</p>

<p>I greatly hope that other naturalists will put this
question to the test of actual investigation on the
spot, but I do not hesitate to assert my conviction
that this will prove to be the case.</p>

<p>The result of my experience among the nests of
the other <i>Nemesias</i>, scores of which I have carefully
examined in many widely separated localities, shows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[ 213 ]</a></span>
that a given spider is invariably associated with a
fixed type of nest.</p>

<p>Thus, Cannes is from fifty to sixty miles distant
from San Remo, but the nests of <i>N. c&aelig;mentaria</i>, <i>N.
Manderstjern&aelig;</i>, and <i>N. Eleanora</i> show precisely the
same characteristics in either place.</p>

<p>Moreover, the twelve nests referred to were not all
taken from one restricted locality at Bordeaux, but
were found presenting the same characteristics and
occupied by the same spider in three distinct habitats,
distant some miles from one another. In two nests
several young spiders were found with the mother,
and, in one case where the family consisted of twenty-three
young ones, I observed that they were not all
equally small, and some had nearly attained one-third
of their full size.</p>

<p>This agreed with the fact that no very small nests
were observed, and it seems probable that the young
are not turned out of their nursery quite so early as
some of their relations are at Mentone. This, however,
varies perhaps in accordance with changes of
climate and local conditions.</p>

<p>We failed to detect any other type of nest at
Bordeaux than the one described above: and even
the cork nests, which we had shortly before seen in
such abundance at Montpellier, were apparently
absent.</p>

<p>Bordeaux is by far the north-westernmost point in
Europe<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> at which any spider constructing a true
trap-door nest has as yet been discovered; and the
fact that they exist in a climate so different from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[ 214 ]</a></span>
that of the Riviera and of the whole Mediterranean
region, leads me to hope that their range may in
reality be much more widely extended than has
hitherto been supposed to be the case.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_139" id="Footnote_139"></a><a href="#FNanchor_139"><span class="label">[32]</span></a> Cork nests have however been mentioned as occurring in the neighbourhood
of Lyons, which lies in nearly the same parallel of latitude with Bordeaux.</p></div>

<p>A glance at the vegetation of this district will
suffice to show how little there is that betokens either
a warm or dry winter climate; for here the myrtles,
oranges and olives are left far behind, and in their
place we see tall hedgerow elms, and poplars bearing
mistletoe on their branches.</p>

<p>Here therefore we are met by the question, How do
these Bordeaux spiders contrive to live under conditions
so different from those to which their relations
on the Riviera have adapted themselves? How do
they bear the cold and damp of the long winter, and
how is it that one frail upper door suffices to protect
their nest from molestation?</p>

<p>The thick coating of dead leaves, which covered
the banks even when we found them, no doubt aids
largely in their concealment, and the colder climate
probably diminishes the number of their enemies, but
their means of subsistence are most likely also less abundant
and their period of active life shorter.</p>

<p>The next type we have to consider is a totally new
one, and may be distinguished as the <i>single-door
branched wafer nest</i>. I detected this nest at Montpellier
but a few days before the visit to Bordeaux alluded to
above.</p>

<p>Circumstances unfortunately prevented me from
following up my discovery as closely as I could have
wished, and it appears moreover that this nest is far
less common at Montpellier than the typical cork
nest (<i>Nemesia c&aelig;mentaria</i>).</p>


<div id="Plate_XVII" class="fig_center" style="width: 336px;">
<div class="fig_caption"><i>Plate XVII.</i></div>
<a href="images/plate17lg.png"><img src="images/plate17.png" width="336" height="609" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[ 215 ]</a></span></p>

<p>I hope therefore that other naturalists will make
further investigations, and especially that they will
endeavour to secure the male.</p>

<p>I obtained twelve spiders and thoroughly followed
the course of ten nests; I opened thirteen more
nests, but failed to trace their structure satisfactorily.</p>

<p>The upper part of this nest is shown of the natural
size in <a href="#Plate_XVII">Plate XVII</a> with the spider (<i>Nemesia suffusa</i>,
Camb.<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>) which constructs it. This is again a wafer
nest without any lower door, and this absence of a
lower door alone distinguishes it as a type from the
branched nest represented at F in the diagram, just
as the same deficiency separated the Bordeaux type
from that at fig. E.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_140" id="Footnote_140"></a><a href="#FNanchor_140"><span class="label">[33]</span></a> We have again in this instance an exemplification of the rule that a new
type of nest indicates the presence of a new spider, and hitherto, this rule has
proved without exception. Mr. Pickard-Cambridge's description of <i>N. suffusa</i>
will be found at p. 295, below. Its slender proportions, cylindrico-ovate abdomen,
marked with narrow linear chevrons, and caput without, or almost without,
any median line or marking, form some of its more striking characteristics.</p></div>

<p>In this new single-door branched type, the branch
makes a more or less acute angle with the main tube,
and reaches the surface of the ground, but is there
closed by a layer of particles of earth slightly bound
together with silk, forming an immovable cover or
thatch. This cover constitutes, however, but a slight
obstruction and could easily be torn away by the
spider if she needed to use this passage as a way of
escape.</p>

<p>These nests were tolerably plentiful at a place
called Les Mourines, a short distance from Montpellier,
where they were mixed with cork nests in the
steep hedge banks. The nests were from 8 to 10
inches deep, and, as in all the trap-door nests which I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[ 216 ]</a></span>
have examined, were tenanted by the female alone.
It seems strange that this spider, building as she
does a nest apparently but poorly furnished either for
concealment or defence, should be able to enter into
competition with <i>N. c&aelig;mentaria</i>, whose solid, closely-fitting
door appears so perfectly contrived for both.
It will probably be found, however, when we are better
acquainted with their respective ways of life, that
they are really more nearly on a footing than they
seem to be at first sight. I detected the remains of
ants and the elytra of a beetle in one of these branched
single-door nests. Now these may also be found in
cork nests, so that <i>Nemesia suffusa</i> evidently competes
with <i>c&aelig;mentaria</i> for its food, and this is of course the
main cause of contention between all living creatures.</p>

<p>It is possible, that, if we knew all the uses to
which the branch is put by the spider which constructs
it, we should find that the advantages derived
in the way of security from the existence of this
second passage, counterbalance those possessed by
the cork nest, which, though so perfectly closed, has
only the one tube, and no other possible way of
escape.</p>

<p>It may perhaps be no more than a coincidence, but
we can scarcely avoid commenting upon the fact,
that, just as this Montpellier wafer nest is simpler in
construction than any found along the Riviera, so in
like manner is the Bordeaux nest simpler than that
of Montpellier. It thus becomes tempting to ask
whether, in the case of these wafer nests, we shall
not discover that the colder and damper climates are
the homes of the builders of the simpler types, while
the warmer and drier ones, where more food, more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[ 217 ]</a></span>
enemies and more competitors are found, are reserved
for the architects of the more complicated nests.</p>

<p>Doubtless naturalists will soon discover wafer nests
on the slopes of the Pyrenees, as for example at Pau
and other winter stations in South-western France;
and perhaps the coast of the Bay of Biscay may also
yield specimens, even to the north of Bordeaux. If
so, this curious speculation as to whether there is any
relation between simplicity of structure and warmth
of climate, will be put on its trial.</p>

<p>About the very time when I was engaged in digging
out these new wafer nests at Montpellier, the celebrated
arachnologist, Dr. L. Koch of Nuremberg, had just
published<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> an account and figure of a very remarkable
nest which he had received from Australia, and which,
though differing both in form and proportions from
the Montpellier nest, may nevertheless perhaps be
referred to the present single-door branched wafer type.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_141" id="Footnote_141"></a><a href="#FNanchor_141"><span class="label">[34]</span></a> Dr. L. Koch, <i>Arachniden Australiens</i>, 10te. Lieferuug, Nurnberg, 1874,
tab. xxxvii. fig. 3, p. 484.</p></div>

<p>This Australian nest, the exact habitat of which
is not mentioned, is constructed by a spider now described
for the first time under the name of <i>Idioctis
helva</i>. The nest has a wafer-door about the size of a
sixpence, closing a vertical tube less than half an
inch long, which meets and opens into a horizontal
tube about three inches in length, and forms with it
what may be roughly likened to the figure of a capital
T inverted, thus, &#9529;.</p>

<p>The upstroke of the T is however, very short, and
one of the arms is longer than the other, and curved
downwards at its extremity. This is, as far as I know,
the first recorded example of a wafer-nest from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[ 218 ]</a></span>
Antipodes, and it may be regarded as one of the first
fruits of a harvest which lies ready for the reaping
of any naturalist resident in those parts. Hitherto the
only nests which I have seen or heard of from Australia
were of the cork type (<i>Ants and Spiders</i>, p. 132).</p>

<p>Next in order to the single-door branched wafer
comes the <i>double-door unbranched wafer</i> type, which
is the simplest of all the nests possessing two doors.
This habitation, the work of <i>N. Eleanora</i>, has been
already described (<i>Ants and Spiders</i>, p. 106), and I have
not much to add to the account there given.</p>

<p>Perhaps some of my readers may remember that,
while I was actually engaged on the proofs of <i>Ants
and Spiders</i> I had one of these <i>Eleanora</i> spiders in
captivity, and that I gave an account (p. 148) of her
behaviour up to the latest moment possible. She
had been captured on October 23, 1872, and
placed, together with five young ones found with her
in the nest, on the surface of some earth in a medium-sized
flower-pot covered over with gauze. The young
ones soon made nests for themselves in the earth, each
furnished with its little door, but the mother roamed
about on the surface of the soil, and it was not
until she had been twenty-one days in captivity
that she commenced spinning a silk cell.</p>

<p>This cell in twelve days' time presented the form
of a rude figure of 8, and had an aperture at either
end; it was just large enough to contain the spider
when the legs were extended; its upper surface
was attached to the gauze covering of the pot, and its
lower to the earth. It was at this stage that the
record was broken off, and I will now relate the
remainder of the history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[ 219 ]</a></span></p>

<p>Four days before the cell was commenced, the
spider had covered the under surface of the gauze
with a semi-transparent film of a substance resembling
varnish, which formed a band about three inches
long by half an inch wide, close to where the rim
of the flower-pot threw the most shade. It was at
one extremity of this band that the silk-cell was
formed, but it is important to note that this band of
varnish was longer than the cell, which only measured
an inch and a quarter from end to end, for we shall see
that the layer of varnish was apparently laid with a
view to further operations.</p>

<p>In four days after the completion of the cell its
form was modified, and, during the next ten days
(up to December 21st), the spider gradually thickened
the walls, and made the form of the cell more and
more cylindrical, sometimes closing and at other times
opening the extremities.</p>

<p>Between December 14th and 25th, she lengthened
out the cell by spinning a cylindrical silk tube in prolongation
of one end, and this tube followed the
course of the band of varnish, the whole measuring
three-and-a-half inches in length by about half an inch
in diameter.</p>

<p>It would appear therefore from the correspondence
in length between the band of varnish and this silk
tube, that she had contemplated the construction of
the latter when she first commenced her work on
November 3rd.</p>

<p>On January 19th the silk tube parted from
the gauze, leaving only the enlarged end which
formed the cell still adhering to it. On the
following day I observed the very curious fact
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[ 220 ]</a></span>
that when I sprinkled the nest with water, as it was
my custom to do every morning, the tube, which had
become somewhat flaccid since it had lost its attachment
to the gauze, gradually recovered its perfect
shape. This was repeated for eleven days, until on the
morning of the twelfth day (January 31st), finding
the tube completely collapsed, instead of merely
sprinkling water over it, I drew a large camel-hair
brush loaded with water along its whole length, when
the tube started up, and almost instantaneously regained
its cylindrical form.</p>

<p>This morning the spider had left her cell, and was
roaming about the pot when I wetted the tube, thus
proving that she was in no way concerned with its
movements, which were no doubt due to hygrometric
action.</p>

<p>Between this time and February 25th, I constantly
restored the tube to its shape by wetting it in the
way above described, but on this day it remained very
flaccid, and only expanded partially. For some days
previous to this date, the spider had left the tube when
it collapsed, and only returned to it again when it had
resumed its shape. On the following day I found
the entire silk tube and the cell again collapsed and
lying flat upon the ground, and this time water failed
to produce its previous effect.</p>

<p>The spider then became very restless and excited,
and I observed that the door of one of the little nests
constructed by one of her five offspring which had
been imprisoned in the same pot with her, had been torn
off, and thrown on one side, and there could be little
doubt but that the mother had been guilty of this
very un-maternal action. By the evening she had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[ 221 ]</a></span>
pulled up her collapsed tube from its attachment to
the earth, and had coiled it in a confused heap. Seeing
this, and fearing that, in her distress and excitement,
she might do further damage to the young spiders,
which had up to that time thriven well, I made a
cylindrical hole for her in the earth, supposing that
she would at once take possession of it. On the
following morning, however, the mother spider had
advanced some way in building another figure-of-8 cell,
rising the shrivelled silk of her previous dwelling as a
foundation.</p>

<p>In twenty-four hours this second cell was complete,
and closely resembled the former one, save that the
smaller end of the 8 was turned in the opposite
direction, but, on examining it, I found to my surprise
that it was empty! The spider had taken possession
of the hole I had made for her, which she had at
first refused to notice, and was busily employed in
lining it with silk and furnishing it with a covering
composed of silk with earth and fragments of moss
woven into the surface. By mid-day the aperture
was completely closed, but there was no moveable
door. From this time (February 28) up to April 12,
the spider lived in this hole, which she eventually
furnished with a distinct wafer-door, and, as I found
on opening the nest, with a typical lower door also.
This latter was not neatly made, but still it possessed
all features the essential which characterize these
lower doors in the nests of <i>N. Eleanora</i>.</p>

<p>So this captive <i>Nemesia Eleanora</i> lived in a flower-pot
in my bedroom for more than five months and a
half, during which time she absolutely refused to
burrow or to attempt any kind of excavation, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[ 222 ]</a></span>
passed the greater part of that period on the surface
of the earth in a silk tube ending in an oblong enlargement,
utterly unlike her normal habitation.
Finally, when I had done the digging for her, she
furnished the cylindrical hole I had bored in the
earth with a silk lining, and made it secure with her
own two typical doors.</p>

<p>The figure-of-8 cell which she constructed at first,
and subsequently modified until it became the oblong
enlargement of the tube alluded to above, was totally
unlike any form of trap-door spider's nest known to
me; but in its ultimate shape (which resembled that
of the glass part of a thermometer with an oblong
bulb, save that it was curved and not straight), I
think we may trace some resemblance to the silk tube
which is made by <i>Atypus</i>, and of which a figure is
given at A, <a href="#Plate_XIII">Plate XIII</a>, p. 183; the mouth of the tube
made by my captive was, however, open. It is curious,
also, when we recall this resemblance, to note that
Mr. Brown has recorded, in his observations alluded
to above (p. 185), that the tube of one of the nests of
<i>Atypus</i>, which he brought home in a collapsed state,
showed a somewhat similar tendency to become distended.
For, on opening the box in which they had
been carried, he perceived a movement throughout
the tube as if it were becoming inflated, and though
this inflation appeared to subside shortly after, yet the
following morning the tube had recovered its cylindrical
shape. I am tempted to believe, though this
is mere conjecture, that the box in which these tubes
were put contained moisture, and that their apparent
inflation was due to the same hygrometric action
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[ 223 ]</a></span>
which, was displayed in the tube of <i>N. Eleanora</i>.
I regretted that I was unable to continue my observations
on this captive spider, as it would have been
interesting to know how long she would have lived
contentedly and in good health under the conditions
described above, but I left Mentone at the end of
April, and was unable to take her alive with me to
England. When removed from her nest in the pot
on April 12, she appeared in perfect condition, and I
placed her in a hole which I made for her among
some stones in a garden at the back of the house,
hoping to find her again on my return to Mentone in
the autumn; this hope was, however, not destined to
be realized.</p>

<p>I shall, however, have occasion to speak again of
the young captives of this species (<i>N. Eleanora</i>), in
the concluding remarks which will follow these
detailed accounts of the nests and their occupants,
when the behaviour of captive trap-door spiders generally
will be treated of.</p>

<p>The next type of trap-door nest is one to which I
have found it difficult to assign a descriptive name,
and I am compelled for the present to speak of it as
the <i>Hy&egrave;res double-door branched wafer</i> nest.</p>

<p>One of its most distinctive features is found in the
shape of the lower door, fig. F 1, <a href="#Plate_XIV">Plate XIV</a>, and figs.
A 1, A 2, <a href="#Plate_XVIII">Plate XVIII.</a>, which may be said to be double,
presenting two crowns, one of which fits into the main
tube and the other into the branch, but I could not
see my way to employing this character in naming
the type. The nest is, however, quite distinct from
all the others, and is inhabited by a new species of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[ 224 ]</a></span>
trap-door spider (<i>N. congener</i>, Camb.<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>). The characteristic
portions of this nest are shown in <a href="#Plate_XVIII">Plate XVIII</a>,
and fig. A 3, in the same Plate, represents its occupant.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_142" id="Footnote_142"></a><a href="#FNanchor_142"><span class="label">[35]</span></a> Mr. Pickard-Cambridge's description will be found at p. 292, below. In its
characters this female spider (the male is unknown) most nearly resembles <i>N.
c&aelig;mentaria</i>, but differs, among other points, in markings and in having one or
more spines on the genual joint of leg, these spines being almost always absent
in the same joint in <i>c&aelig;mentaria</i>. The nests of the two species are totally
unlike.</p></div>

<p>The hedge-banks near Hy&egrave;res, and also about the
railway station of the same name, which is some
4 miles from the town itself, are frequently tenanted
by this spider. During a short stay there in May,
1873, I secured a large number of specimens, and
verified the structure of the nest by a careful examination
of thirty-eight examples. The nest is invariably
branched and furnished with a lower door,
but the branch is of variable length, usually short,
and never, as far as I could detect, quite reaches the
surface. In some cases this branch was so short that
it could scarcely contain the spider, and, under these
circumstances, it is not easy to conceive any other use
for it than that of retaining the lower door when not
in use. It may, however, enable the spider to take
up a rather better position when engaged, as she
frequently is if disturbed, in keeping the main tube
closed by pressing the lower door upwards with her
feet, for then her head points downwards, and her
abdomen rests in the branch.</p>


<div id="Plate_XVIII" class="fig_center" style="width: 350px;">
<div class="fig_caption"><i>Plate XVIII.</i></div>
<a href="images/plate18lg.png"><img src="images/plate18.png" width="350" height="609" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[ 225 ]</a></span></p>

<p>I have seen her in this attitude on several occasions
when I had cut out a block of earth similar to that
figured in the plate. The lower door is quite unlike
that of either of the other two double-door wafer
nests, being wedge-shaped, tapering from below upwards
to the hinge, which is always placed at the
point of bifurcation of the tubes, and having two
crowns separated from each other by the gusset-like
web of silk which connects the door on either side
with the lining of the main tube, one of these crowns
fitting into and closing the main tube, while the other
fits into the aperture of the branch.</p>

<p>The wedge-shaped structure of the door is seen in
its most exaggerated form in the nests of the younger
spiders (figs. B, B 1, <a href="#Plate_XVIII">Plate XVIII</a>), and becomes less
so in the older and larger ones (figs. A 1, A 2). I
have even seen some of these lower doors, evidently
made by old spiders, which were so much flattened as to
bear a considerable resemblance to that of <i>N. Eleanora</i>.</p>

<p>The main tube of the nest is from 10 to 12 inches
long, and usually enters the earth almost horizontally,
bending downwards from the point at which the
branch joins it, and where the lower door is hung.
This causes the lower door to lie nearly horizontally
when not in use, and its lower crown probably serves,
by fitting into the aperture of the branch, to sustain
it in this position and prevent it from falling forward.
The point of bifurcation is placed, as a rule, much
nearer to the entrance of the nest, than it is in the
two other branched nests, and occurs usually within
two inches of the surface of the earth; so close is it
indeed that, on lifting the upper door and looking in,
one may frequently see the lower door move across
and close the passage down the main tube, pushed by
the spider from below. This frequently enabled me
to secure the spider without having to follow her to
the bottom of the nest; and, when fortune favoured
me, I secured a block of earth by one rapid sweep of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[ 226 ]</a></span>
the knife (a common table-knife), which furnished me
at once with a good specimen of the nest and of its
occupant.</p>

<p>When the spider has once fairly determined upon
resistance, it is scarcely possible to make her retreat
without destroying the nest, and, in one case, when I
tried to push the lower door down from above, while
she was pressing it upwards from below, I found
that, without crushing my opponent, I could not
succeed.</p>

<p>There were probably young in the nest on this
occasion, for I have frequently found them in the
nests with the mother at this season. In no case did
I even catch a glimpse of the male, and this sex is at
present unknown.</p>

<p>The young spiders make their nests at an early
age, and there can be no doubt that <i>N. congener</i>
enlarges its dwelling from time to time as growth
demands, just as the trap-door spiders at Mentone do.
Indeed in one of these new Hy&egrave;res nests I found,
outside the main tube and some way above the
existing lower door, a former and disused lower door
much smaller than the one then in use, and which
had evidently belonged to the nest at a previous
stage of its development. I have observed this
before in the nests both of <i>N. Manderstjern&aelig;</i> and <i>N.
Eleanora</i>.</p>

<p>This new type is strictly intermediate between the
double-door unbranched wafer nest constructed by
<i>N. Eleanora</i>, and the double-door branched wafer with
the descending cavity which I am now about to
describe.</p>

<p>This latter nest, the work of <i>N. Manderstjern&aelig;</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[ 227 ]</a></span>
Auss.<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> (formerly called <i>N. meridionalis</i>), has already
been partially made known by the figures and description
given of it in <i>Ants and Spiders</i> (Plates IX., X.,
and XI., pp. 98, 100, and 104); but I have to confess,
with great regret, that when these illustrations and descriptions
were published, I was not fully acquainted
with the true structure of this nest, having overlooked
the existence of a short descending cavity which leaves
the main tube a little above and on the opposite side
to the ascending branch. This cavity is always
present, but the very largest and oldest spiders
usually allow it to become filled up with remains
of food and particles of earth, and sometimes even
spin silk across its entrance, in which case it can only
be traced on very close examination.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_143" id="Footnote_143"></a><a href="#FNanchor_143"><span class="label">[36]</span></a> This spider was described by Mr. Pickard-Cambridge at p. 101 in <i>Ants
and Spiders</i>, under the name of <i>N. meridionalis</i>, Costa. This name has now to
be abandoned for reasons given in full by Mr. Cambridge at p. 283, below. It
would appear that a spider discovered by M. Simon in Corsica corresponds more
closely with the <i>N. meridionalis</i> of Costa than our spider of the Riviera does.
Moreover, since <i>Ants and Spiders</i> was written I have had the good fortune to
obtain at Mentone four male examples of our supposed <i>meridionalis</i>, and these
prove to possess the same characters as those assigned by Prof. Ausserer to a
male spider which was captured at Nice, and named by him <i>N. Manderstjern&aelig;</i>.
This specimen is now in the possession of Dr. L. Koch, to whom I am much
indebted for having kindly entrusted it to me for examination. This enabled
Mr. Pickard-Cambridge to assure himself of the specific identity of his
<i>N. meridionalis</i> with <i>N. Manderstjern&aelig;</i>, which latter name it must for the
future bear.</p></div>

<p>It was from an old nest such as this, in which the
descending cavity had been closed up, that the large
drawing at fig. A on Plate IX of <i>Ants and
Spiders</i> was made, and this figure, therefore, still
remains substantially correct.</p>

<p>But in the case of the other illustrations&mdash;namely,
fig. B, Plate IX, fig. A, Plate X, and figs. B and B 1,
Plate XI, where nests of young spiders, or of spiders
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[ 228 ]</a></span>
which, though adult, have not attained the maximum
size, are represented, this descending cavity, though
overlooked by me, should have been shown, for it
must certainly have existed.</p>

<p>Its presence was first observed by the Honourable
L. G. Dillon, who detected it when tracing the course
of the main tube upwards from below. I had always
followed the tube from above downwards, and in so
doing must have unwittingly filled up the descending
cavity (the existence of which I was far from suspecting)
with detached particles of earth.</p>

<p>I will own that, when Mr. Dillon first showed me
this new feature, I hoped that it might prove to be
something accidental and exceptional; and it was
only after careful examination of a large series of
nests of all sizes, that I gradually and almost unwillingly
admitted that this descending cavity formed
an important feature in the typical structure of the
nests.</p>

<p>I now see, however, that the presence of this cavity
adds considerably to the interest of the structure as a
whole, and places its architect quite at the head of
all the builders of trap-door nests. This type should
now be called, for the sake of distinction, the <i>double-door,
branched, cavity, wafer</i> nest, to avoid confusion
with the <i>Hy&egrave;res branched nest</i>.</p>

<p>I am now about to endeavour to atone for my past
oversight by giving new illustrations (<a href="#Plate_XIX">Plate XIX</a>,
figs. A and B) and descriptions of this very remarkable
nest; while I would at the same time beg the indulgence
of my readers for past and present shortcomings,
reminding them that the interest which attaches to
structures of this kind is proportioned to the complexity
and subtlety of their contrivance, and, therefore,
to the difficulty we experience in properly understanding
and describing them.</p>


<div id="Plate_XIX" class="fig_center" style="width: 336px;">
<div class="fig_caption"><i>Plate XIX.</i></div>
<a href="images/plate19lg.png"><img src="images/plate19.png" width="336" height="598" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[ 229 ]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be seen by a reference to <a href="#Plate_XIX">Plate XIX</a>,<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> figs.
A and A 1, that in addition to the cylindrical branch,
which mounts upwards, there is a shorter branch
which leaves the main tube on the opposite side (on
the left as seen in the Plate), and takes a downward
course. Now this descending branch, which is barely
more than an inch in length, is a cavity of variable
form, being sometimes cylindrical, and sometimes egg- or
even watch-shaped,<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> but there is one particular in
which it never varies, and that is the position of its
elliptic orifice. This orifice is always situated on the
opposite side of the main tube to that on which the
ascending branch leaves this latter, so that the whole
nest, when seen in section, presents the figure
of a St. Andrew's cross, only with arms of unequal
length.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_144" id="Footnote_144"></a><a href="#FNanchor_144"><span class="label">[37]</span></a> A nest of a scarcely half-grown spider is here represented in order that
sufficient space might be gained to show the lower door in its two positions.
The perfect cavity is still found in nests of much larger dimensions, and occasionally,
indeed, in nests of almost the maximum size.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_145" id="Footnote_145"></a><a href="#FNanchor_145"><span class="label">[38]</span></a> I take the liberty of coining a word to replace "lenticular," the form of a
watch being more familiar than that of a lens.</p></div>

<p>But the most remarkable point is that, when the
lower door is pushed across so as to close the main
tube (as shown in fig. A, <a href="#Plate_XIX">Plate XIX</a>), it will invariably
be found to lie in such a position that its
lower extremity exactly meets the lower lip of the
orifice of the descending cavity, when it will be seen
that the semi-cylindrical surface of the lower door
then coincides with, and appears to continue and
form part of, the lower wall of the descending cavity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[ 230 ]</a></span>
on the one side, and of the corresponding wall of the
main tube on the other. When the upper portion of
the main tube is thus united to the cavity the two
combine to form what appears like a short, independent
unbranched nest.</p>

<p>Now, if we fancy ourselves an insect entering the
nest in search either of the spider, her eggs, or young,
I think it is plain that, when the lower door is in
this position (fig. A), we should probably walk straight
down to the bottom of the cavity, expecting to find
our prey there, and should then return by the way we
came, impressed with the belief that we had explored
the whole nest, the secret of the lower door remaining
undiscovered.</p>

<p>Whether this imaginary case may, or may not,
represent what really takes place, is of course mere
conjecture; but the constant occurrence of this beautiful
adaptation of the various parts to one another,
surely points to the conclusion that this is no mere
coincidence, but rather a subtle contrivance having
some very definite use and meaning.</p>

<p>We must admit, however, that it is difficult to
conceive why, if this structure is of such great utility,
it should be abandoned by the oldest and largest
spiders.</p>

<p>Among the possible answers to this question I
think that one of the more probable is that this
arrangement may have been specially devised for
protection against some enemy which the aged spiders
have ceased to fear.</p>

<p>Indeed it is not unlikely that these aged spiders
may have come to a time of life when they no longer
lay eggs, and so do not need to keep up all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[ 231 ]</a></span>
defences which they employed when they had families
to protect.</p>

<p>Since my attention was drawn to the existence of
this cavity in the dwellings of <i>N. Manderstjern&aelig;</i> I have
never noted the presence of young in those nests in
which the cavity was filled up and disused; but then
I have only exact records with reference to this point
in the case of seven nests.</p>

<p>In these seven nests, however, there was no free
cavity, and there were no young spiders, though it
was at the season when it was common to find young
in the nests.</p>

<p>The question, therefore, remains open, and further
observations on this head would be very acceptable.
I detected the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of insects, and especially the
horny coats of ants, in the descending cavity, in many
nests; and in some of the oldest, where it had become
completely blocked up, these remains still indicated
its former outlines and position.</p>

<p>The nests of <i>N. Manderstjern&aelig;</i> at Cannes correspond
both in respect of the cavity and of their other characteristics
with those at Mentone. <i>N. Manderstjern&aelig;</i>
occurs pretty abundantly at San Remo in the olive-grounds
east of the Sanctuary, but I can say nothing
as to whether the nests there possessed the cavity or
not, for, when I was there, I was not aware of its
existence. I obtained a single example of <i>N. Manderstjern&aelig;</i>
and its nest at Hy&egrave;res, and this is the
westernmost point at which this species has as yet
been detected.</p>

<p>We have now passed in review all the seven known
types of true trap-door nest, and have taken note also
of the lower and more rudimentary forms of nest,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[ 232 ]</a></span>
such as that of <i>Atypus</i>, and the funnel nest of <i>Cyrtauchenius
elongatus</i>, neither of which is furnished with
a door.</p>

<p>Among the true trap-door nests, those of the cork
type stand in a measure alone, being distinguished
from all the others by their solid surface doors, composed
of many layers of silk and earth; and we do
not at present know of any intermediate forms linking
the cork and wafer types together. But among the
various nests which represent the wafer type the case
is different, for here the types naturally fall into a
progressive series, such as that represented in the
diagrams (<a href="#Plate_XIV">Pl. XIV</a>, p. 193).</p>

<p>If we try to picture to ourselves the stages through
which the most complicated wafer nest&mdash;namely, that
of the <i>double-door, branched, cavity</i> type (Diagram G 1)
may have passed in the course of its development
from a simpler ancestral form, we should <i>&agrave; priori</i>
expect to find precisely such structures as the <i>Hy&egrave;res
double-door branched</i> nest (Diagram F), and the <i>single-door
branched</i> nest (Diagram D) forming successive
halting-places in the advance from the primitive
<i>single-door, unbranched</i> nest (Diagram C).</p>

<p>The <i>double-door unbranched</i> type may in like manner
find its prototype in the same original single-door unbranched
nest (C), which we may look upon as the
parent idea, from which all these structures have been
derived.</p>

<p>Bearing this in mind, and remembering that kinship
between living creatures is not only revealed to
us by likeness in structure and colour, but also by
similarity in habits and instincts, it becomes of interest
to trace any resemblance that may exist between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[ 233 ]</a></span>
these wafer-nests and the dwellings constructed by
<i>Lycosa narbonensis</i>, a species belonging to the allied
family of <i>Lycosid&aelig;</i>, and which closely resembles the
true <i>tarantula</i><a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> of Southern Italy.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_146" id="Footnote_146"></a><a href="#FNanchor_146"><span class="label">[39]</span></a> In the United States, and indeed in the New World generally, it seems to
be the custom to call all the larger "ground spiders," and especially the trap-door
spiders, Tarantulas, but these, in fact, form a distinct group by themselves,
belonging to the family <i>Lycosid&aelig;</i>.</p></div>

<p>I first made the acquaintance of <i>Lycosa narbonensis</i>
near the glass-works west of Cannes, where this
spider may not rarely be found living in tubular
burrows in sandy clearings among the pine woods
along the shore (<i>Pinus pinea</i>, the stone pine).</p>

<p>I have already (<i>Ants and Spiders</i>, p. 146), alluded
to an account given by M. L&eacute;on Dufour of his observations
on the nest and habits of the true tarantula
(<i>Lycosa tarentula</i>), which he discovered in Spain.</p>

<p>The nests of <i>L. narbonensis</i> at Cannes resembled
those described by M. Dufour, but the cylindrical,
subterranean burrows were apparently shorter. It
was extremely difficult to trace their course, on account
of the loose sand which poured into the tubes
and choked them up, and I only succeeded in doing
so completely in one case, when I stuffed the tube
with cotton-wool before proceeding to dig. Here the
open tube, which was quite simple, and about 1 inch
in diameter, descended vertically for 3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inches, and
was then suddenly bent so as to become horizontal,
terminating shortly afterwards in a triangular chamber,
the floor of which measured 2 inches across at the
widest part, and was strewed with the remains of
beetles and other insects.</p>

<p>The nest was lined throughout with coarse silk,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[ 234 ]</a></span>
which had a blackish hue, owing to the presence of
the filaments of what I believe to have been some undeveloped
fungoid growth. The mouth of the tube
was open, and frequently surmounted by a short
tubular prolongation, commencing at the surface of
the ground, which formed a sort of chimney about an
inch high and from an inch to an inch and a quarter
across; this was composed of fibres of plants, pine-needles,
and especially of a large branching lichen,
very common in the neighbourhood of the nests, and
all these materials were woven together and kept
in place by a few threads of silk spun here and
there.</p>

<p>It was not every nest that was furnished with a
chimney, nor were all the chimneys equally complete,
for in some cases they consisted merely of a small
rim or one-sided lip, while in others they resembled
little birds' nests, and were sufficiently firm and compact
to permit of my carrying them away. It appeared
to me that these chimneys served as screens to
prevent the loose sand from being swept into the
burrows by the winds which rage over that open seashore
plain, and that they were more or less complete
in proportion as the exposure was greater or less, and
the sand looser or more bound together.</p>

<p>I captured eight of these spiders, and here, as in
the trap-door group, the female alone inhabited the
nest.</p>

<p>Besides this habit, they have other points in common
with trap-door spiders; such, for example, as
the resemblance which exists between this nest and
that of <i>Theraphosa Blondii</i> from Brazil (see p. 188,
above), and between the chimney of this Tarantula
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[ 235 ]</a></span>
and the a&euml;rial prolongation of the tube sometimes
found in nests of the wafer type.</p>

<p>But perhaps the most suggestive point of resemblance
consists in the habit which this Tarantula
possesses of covering and closing the aperture of the
nest during the winter with a thin layer of materials,
similar to those of which the chimney is composed,
and, like them, bound together with silk. This is, in
fact, an immovable wafer-door, and precisely resembles
those which I have seen constructed by
<i>Nemesia Manderstjern&aelig;</i>, and <i>N. Eleanora</i>, when captive
and placed in an artificial hole in the earth.</p>

<p>The tubes are, as has been already stated, open
during the spring, and we may suppose that the
spider, on the approach of warm weather, wakes up
from her winter lethargy, and tears away this concealing
thatch. But if one of these spiders should
by chance happen to free this silk-woven thatch by
cutting round some three-fourths of its circumference,
so as to leave it still attached to the rim of the
aperture of the nest by the remaining quarter, she
would then have made for herself a veritable, though
rather rude trap-door of the wafer kind.</p>

<p>It is most likely, however, that the spider knows
what she is about and that a door to her dwelling
would be the reverse of an advantage to her, for she
is more powerful and swifter than the generality of
European trap-door spiders, and, as she probably
lives by leaping out upon and hunting her prey, she
no doubt needs to have the entrance to her nest free
of all encumbrance.</p>

<p>I am indebted to the Rev. W. G. Brackenridge
for evidence of the very interesting fact that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[ 236 ]</a></span>
<i>Lycosa narbonensis</i> closes her nest at Cannes in the
winter.</p>

<p>I was aware that Latreille stated that the Tarantula
possessed this habit,<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> and I was anxious to know
whether the species which I had detected at Cannes,
inhabiting as it did open nests in the month of May,
would also exhibit this curious custom. Being unable
to visit Cannes myself during the winter, I applied to
Mr. Brackenridge, who, on the 28th of January last
(1874), secured a very perfect specimen of the a&euml;rial
portion or chimney of one of the nests having the
orifice closed in the way above described, and most
kindly transmitted it to me.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_147" id="Footnote_147"></a><a href="#FNanchor_147"><span class="label">[40]</span></a> P. A. Latreille, Mem. Soc. Hist. Nat., Paris (an. VII. de la R&eacute;publique),
p. 124: "L'araign&eacute;e <i>tarentule</i> ferme aussi son habitation, mais cet opercule n'est
pas mobile, et n'est construit que pour l'hiver."</p></div>

<p>I have, on a very few occasions, found the doors of
a wafer or cork nest spun up during the winter at
Mentone, and on digging have discovered the spider
alive, though partially torpid, inside; but this is
quite an exceptional event. I should much like to
know, however, whether this becomes the rule in the
case of the nests of those trap-door spiders which
inhabit climates less favoured than that of Mentone.</p>

<p>In my concluding remarks in <i>Ants and Spiders</i> I
called attention to the importance which attaches to
a knowledge of the food and manner of feeding of
any creature whose life-history we may wish to study,
and I would now once more press the subject on
the attention of my readers. For the range and distribution
of a species largely depends upon the
nature of its food, and this will also be an indication
of the rivals with which it has to compete in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[ 237 ]</a></span>
the struggle for existence; the times and seasons
of its activity, and in many cases even the structure
and position of its dwelling-place will be
governed by this same all-important question of food-supply.</p>

<p>I have now detected the remains of insects, and of
ants especially, in the nest of every species of trap-door
spider which I have examined <i>in situ</i>; very frequently,
however, one may open several nests in
succession without finding any of these <i>d&eacute;bris</i>, and at
other times they will only be detected beneath the
existing bottom of the tube, layers of silk having
been spun over successive layers of refuse.</p>

<p>The horny coats of ants form by very far the largest
proportion of these remains, and I have lately been
much struck by the number of instances in which,
while digging out ants' nests at Mentone, I have found
trap-door nests (especially those of <i>N. Manderstjern&aelig;</i>
and <i>N. Moggridgii</i>) in their midst, the tubes often
traversing the very heart of the ants' colony and
coming into close contact with the galleries and
chambers of the ants. The doors in these instances
had almost always escaped my notice, and, indeed,
they so closely resembled the surface of the ground
that even when I knew, from having accidentally cut
across the tube below ground, that one of these doors
must lie near a given spot, yet I could only discover
it by following the passage from below upwards.
This perfect concealment is doubtless of essential
importance to the spiders' success in life, for, if they
once alarmed the whole colony of ants and let them
know the exact whereabouts of their lurking-place,
they would soon learn to avoid it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[ 238 ]</a></span></p>

<p>But, as it is, the work of opening the door,
snatching in an ant, and closing it again, is but the
affair of a second or two, and before the companions
of the victim have time to realize the nature of the
phenomenon, the gaping earth has closed again and
become once more, to all appearance, part of the solid
and trustworthy ground.</p>

<p>I have seen <i>N. Manderstjern&aelig;</i> snatch at insects in this
way during the daytime, and I well remember how I
started on one occasion when, as I was looking fixedly
at a small blue gnat which I had taken for a moth, I
saw the earth suddenly open and one of these spiders
partly emerge, make a swift stroke at the insect, and
withdraw again as swiftly.</p>

<p>I have found the remains of ants, of beetles of
many species and different sizes, of wood-lice (<i>Oniscus</i>),
and of earwigs (<i>Forficula</i>) in the nests of <i>N. Eleanora</i>
and <i>N. Manderstjern&aelig;</i>, and the wings of a large green
field-bug in the nest of the former. I have only once
detected traces of food in the dwellings of <i>Cteniza
Moggridgii</i>, and these consisted of minute fragments
of the integuments of insects, none of which were
certainly recognisable, though I believe that they
partly consisted of the coats of a small species of ant.
The rarity or complete absence of the wings of insects
which habitually fly rather than crawl on the ground,
and my inability to discover either snares or any
evidence that these spiders ever leave the nest, lead
me to believe that they live (at any rate from October
to May) by dragging into their nests any insects
which approach within reach.</p>

<p>Ants, earwigs, beetles, and wood-lice are precisely
the very creatures which would fall a prey to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[ 239 ]</a></span>
spider without obliging her to leave her nest, and it is
accordingly their remains that we find.</p>

<p>On one occasion, however, at Montpellier, my sister
detected <i>N. c&aelig;mentaria</i> in the act of devouring a fair-sized
caterpillar, to obtain which there is some reason
to think she must have left her nest. We were out
together on the 8th of May last (1874), hunting for
the new wafer nests of that district, under the kind
guidance of M. Lichtenstein, when my sister called
our attention to a caterpillar, the body of which partly
projected from the tube of a cork nest (<i>N. c&aelig;mentaria</i>),
and prevented the lid from closing.</p>

<p>On closer examination we found that the spider
was in the act of devouring the caterpillar, and had
already sucked out the juices from the anterior portion,
while the middle and posterior parts of the body
still resisted, and the legs clung tenaciously to the lip
of the nest.</p>

<p>M. Lichtenstein told us that this larva, which when
entire must have been rather more than an inch long,
was that of the mullein moth (<i>Cucullia verbasci</i>).</p>

<p>It was not full grown, and as there were no mullein
plants within some two feet of the nest and this
caterpillar will not leave the plant on which it feeds
unless compelled, it would seem as if the spider must
have gone afield in order to capture it. It is possible,
nevertheless, that the caterpillar may have fallen
within reach of the spider when blown off the mullein
leaves by the wind.</p>

<p>I have, unfortunately, but few details to give of the
nocturnal habits of the trap-door spiders. It would
appear, however, that they are more active by night
than by day, and that it is more common to find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[ 240 ]</a></span>
their doors ajar at night, with the spiders posted
on the look-out at the narrow opening. This is
borne out by my observations on captive spiders, to
which I shall allude shortly.</p>

<p>When at Hy&egrave;res on the 11th of May, 1873, the
evening being very warm and a bright moon shining,
I went at 8:30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> with my father and sister to see
what the spiders would be doing on a hedge bank
where we had previously marked five cork and eight
wafer nests. The moonlight did not fall upon this
spot, but I was provided with a lantern, and by its
light the nests at first appeared to be tightly closed,
but we soon perceived first one and then another with
the door slightly raised, ready to close on the smallest
alarm, whether from a footfall or from the flickering
of the lamp. When the light of the lantern was
steady it did not appear to frighten the spiders in the
least, even when brought to within a few inches of
the door,<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> and this enabled me to watch them very
closely. On either side of the raised door of one of
the wafer nests I could see the feet of the spider
projecting, and just at that moment I caught sight of
a beetle close at hand, feeding on the topmost spray
of some small plant below. Using every precaution,
I contrived to gather the spray without shaking off
the beetle, and gradually pushed it nearer and nearer
to the nest. When it almost touched the lip of the
nest the door flew open, and the spider snatched at
the beetle and dragged it down below.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_148" id="Footnote_148"></a><a href="#FNanchor_148"><span class="label">[41]</span></a> This had been observed before both by my father and Mr. Dillon when
watching the trap-door spiders at night at Mentone.</p></div>

<p>For a few seconds the door remained tightly closed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[ 241 ]</a></span>
and then, to our great surprise, was suddenly opened
again, and the beetle was cast alive and unharmed
out of the nest. I immediately secured the insect,
which proved to be the common <i>Chrysomela Banksii</i>.<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_149" id="Footnote_149"></a><a href="#FNanchor_149"><span class="label">[42]</span></a> I am indebted to Mr. F. Smith for the name.</p></div>

<p>I cannot doubt that this beetle was distasteful in
some way to the spider, for it was neither so large nor
so powerful as many beetles the remains of which I
have found in the spiders' nests, and, besides, it did
not escape from the nest, but was distinctly rejected
by its captor.</p>

<p>This shows that this spider does not know instinctively
what insects to reject and what to take.</p>

<p>This little episode was scarcely ended when I
espied a wood-louse (<i>Oniscus</i>) walking down the bank,
not far from another of these wafer nests. By a little
guidance I managed so to turn its course that this
unsuspicious crustacean went straight to the very
point I wished, and made as if it would walk over the
spider's door; but no sooner was it well within reach
than, quick as thought, the spider clutched it and
dragged it in. No rejection followed on this capture,
and, though I could not actually witness the conclusion
of this adventure, I do not doubt that it ended
in a tragedy and a supper.</p>

<p>In these two cases, as in all those previously noted,
the spiders did not leave the nest nor allow the door
to close behind them, but kept it propped up on the
abdomen and hindmost pair of legs. In this way the
act of seizing their prey, and that of withdrawing
into the nest, were almost simultaneous.</p>

<p>In no case did we see any of these spiders out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[ 242 ]</a></span>
their nests, and their behaviour by night appeared to
be the same as by day, only that they were bolder
and more on the alert.</p>

<p>The spiders in the cork nests (<i>N. Moggridgii</i>) resisted
our attempts to raise their doors just as rigorously
as in the daytime.</p>

<p>All the spiders which I have kept in captivity have
shown themselves more active at night than during
the day, and I imagine that experience has taught
them that fewer of their enemies are then abroad,
while ants, beetles, wood-lice, and other creatures upon
which they prey are quite as nocturnal as themselves.</p>

<p>I brought back to England some young cork and
wafer spiders from Hy&egrave;res, and one adult cork (<i>N.
Moggridgii</i>). The latter was placed in a small tin
box, with moss and a little earth at the bottom, on
the evening of May the 10th, 1873, and by next
morning she had made a silk tube through the moss,
carrying up earth from below for the purpose of
strengthening its walls on the outside. On the 13th
of May the tube was furnished with a perfect door.</p>

<p>I hoped that this spider might lay eggs in her
prison,<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> and therefore broke up her nest from time to
time after my return to London in order to search
for them. Between the 27th of May (when her nest
had been transferred into a box of earth) and the 6th
of October I destroyed her dwelling four times, and
after each demolition she furnished the cylindrical
hole which I bored for her with a lid, having thus
made five doors since her capture. I got no eggs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[ 243 ]</a></span>
however, though the spider appeared in perfect
health.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_150" id="Footnote_150"></a><a href="#FNanchor_150"><span class="label">[43]</span></a> Strange to say, though I have opened so many nests at different seasons of
the year, and found young apparently quite recently hatched, I have never been
able to find the eggs of a trap-door spider.</p></div>

<p>Neither this spider nor the true <i>N. c&aelig;mentaria</i> of
Montpellier appears to have any idea of digging a hole
when placed on soft earth if they are adult; and the
same thing is true of <i>N. Manderstjern&aelig;</i> and <i>N. Eleanora</i>,
but the young of all these spiders readily excavate
nests for themselves.</p>

<p>I have once seen a nearly full grown, and probably
adult, <i>Cteniza Moggridgii</i> make a perfect tube and
furnish it with a moveable door in a single night
when confined under gauze on moist earth, but this
is the only instance (except that of <i>Cteniza Californica</i>,
recorded above) in which I have known an adult trap-door
spider excavate or attempt to do so.</p>

<p>These <i>Ctenizas</i> seem to be peculiarly able to adapt
themselves to circumstances, for two young ones,
which I sent by post to M. Lucas at the Jardin des
Plantes in Paris in little wide-mouthed, cylindrical,
blue glass bottles, not only lined the bottles with
silk but also closed them at the mouth with a door
fitting accurately into a bevelled lip, in the manufacture
of both of which fragments of moss, the only
material at their disposal, were used in place of
earth.<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> It is curious to see how quickly the young
trap-door spiders, both of the cork and wafer kinds,
when taken from the nest of the mother, will make
their own perfect little dwellings in captivity, and I
have known them construct tube and door within
fifteen hours.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_151" id="Footnote_151"></a><a href="#FNanchor_151"><span class="label">[44]</span></a> M. H. Lucas, in <i>Bull. des S&eacute;ances de la Soc. Entom. de Fr.</i> No. 27
(1874), p. 101.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[ 244 ]</a></span></p></div>

<p>I have watched the proceedings of the young
spiders, when taken from the mother's nest, in the
following species: <i>Nemesia Manderstjern&aelig;</i>, <i>N. Eleanora</i>,
<i>N. congener</i>, and <i>N. Moggridgii</i>, the three first
constructing wafer, and the last a cork nest. All of
these very young spiders will excavate their own
tubes and bring out pellets of the earth, which closely
resemble those carried out from their galleries by
the ants.</p>

<p>As has been stated before, the young brood, while
still in the mother's nest, will often comprise individuals
of different sizes, and though the majority are
no larger than the baby-spider represented at Fig.
B 2, Pl. IX, <i>Ants and Spiders</i>, some may occasionally
be found that are fully twice as large.</p>

<p>The little nests which they make in captivity
vary accordingly in size. Thus, out of sixteen
young taken from the mother's nest (<i>N. Eleanora</i>),
eleven, three days after capture, had made nests in the
earth of a flower-pot, and the wafer doors of six of
these nests measured 2 lines across, of four 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>
lines, and of one 3 lines. The first nests of another
similar lot of young <i>Eleanora</i> spiders had wafer doors
measuring respectively 2, 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>, 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>, 3 and 3 lines. In
another case when I captured fourteen young (the
entire brood found in the nest of the mother, <i>N.
Manderstjern&aelig;</i>), after the lapse of five days every one
of them had made a nest, but these were smaller and
more uniform, ten of the wafer doors measuring 2
lines across, one 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>, and one 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>These little spiders need to be kept constantly supplied
with flies, which should be killed and placed near
their nests; they are often so greedy that they will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[ 245 ]</a></span>
attempt to drag a house-fly entire down their tubes
for which it is much too large, when the door is
pushed open, and the fly remains sticking in the
entrance to the nest with its legs up in the air. One
may even feed these spiders oneself by approaching
carefully and, without causing any vibration, pushing
the fly, placed on the end of a pencil, within reach of
the spider.</p>

<p>I have given my reasons before (<i>Ants and Spiders</i>,
p. 127) for believing that the trap-door spiders do not
as a rule desert their nests, but enlarge them from time
to time to meet their own requirements of growth;
showing, by a comparison of the measurements of the
doors of eight nests in April with those of the same
nests in the following October, that all had increased
in size.</p>

<p>Subsequent observations have confirmed this; I find
that the young spiders taken from the mother's nest enlarge
their nests in captivity in a precisely similar way.</p>

<p>Thus, for example, the wafer doors of three young
<i>Eleanora</i> spiders, made within a few days after their
removal from the mother's nest on February 20th,
1873, and first measured on February 28th, had
increased between that date and Nov. 29th following
from 2 to 4 lines, 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> to 4 lines, and 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> to 6 lines
respectively.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that the male and female spiders
are undistinguishable when very young, as it would
be interesting to know whether the males construct
nests before they take to their adult life, during which
they roam from place to place and hide under stones.</p>

<p>In one case fourteen young spiders, forming this
entire family taken with a female <i>N. Manderstjern&aelig;</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[ 246 ]</a></span>
made nests; so that unless all of these were females,
we have evidence here to prove that the males do
commence life by building nests for themselves.</p>

<p>I kept the male <i>Cteniza Moggridgii</i>, for ten days on
damp earth in captivity, but he made no attempt to
excavate or spin, and wandered restlessly about,
scarcely touching the flies<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> with which I supplied him.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_152" id="Footnote_152"></a><a href="#FNanchor_152"><span class="label">[45]</span></a> I habitually fed my captive spiders with common house-flies, and it
was curious to see how entirely the latter were wanting in any instinctive
fear of even the largest spiders. They would creep between the spiders' legs,
causing them to start as if electrified, and frequently it was not until the flies,
after repeating this annoyance several times, actually walked up to and almost
touched the fangs of the spider, that they were punished for their ignorance and
presumption.</p></div>

<p>Seeing this I could not venture to prolong his
captivity, as I feared to risk injuring a specimen which
was quite unique and which there was little likelihood
of my being able to replace. It is rather curious
that M. Simon should also have found one male,
and one only, of the closely-related <i>Ct. fodiens</i> of
Corsica, and that his specimen should be, like mine,
the only one known.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind the curious problems which arise
as to the affinities of the flora and fauna of the Alpes
Maritimes with that of Corsica, the fact that the
species of <i>Cteniza</i> which is found at Mentone, though
allied to, is yet distinct from the insular species, gains
a new interest.</p>

<p>We ask ourselves whether the Corsican species
sprang from that of the Alpes Maritimes, or <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>;
or again, whether both diverged in remote times from
a common ancestor. Questions such as these cannot
be answered at present, but I hope the day may
come when the geographical distribution of the various
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[ 247 ]</a></span>
existing forms of life will be traced with sufficient
accuracy to enable us to follow on the map the lines
along which affinity travels; and thus point out at
once the probable relationship between two given
forms, and also the route by which they reached their
present stations. Records of local varieties, and the
careful discrimination between forms which have
small but permanent points of difference, thus acquire
an importance which they would not otherwise possess.</p>

<p>The geographical distribution of trap-door spiders
is of peculiar interest on account of the sedentary
habits maintained during life by the females. Most
animals are capable of travelling long distances, or of
being accidentally transported from place to place in
such a way that colonies are frequently established
far away from the parent settlement, and we are left
in the dark as to whence they came and who are their
nearest relations. But, in the case of spiders inhabiting
true trap-door nests, this is not so; they begin
life immediately on leaving the parent nest by
making homes for themselves near at hand which
they will not desert, and there is no likelihood of
their being accidentally carried from place to place
unless occasionally by running water. Thus it happens
that whenever we find the same trap-door
spider at two distant localities, we may feel tolerably
sure that the species has travelled from one to the
other by gradual extension, and that, either now or
in times past, it occupied all the intervening country.</p>

<p>For instance, we find <i>Nemesia Eleanora</i> at Mentone,
and again at Cannes, while it has not yet been
detected at Nice, Antibes, nor any other intermediate
point; but according to this hypothesis, this species
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[ 248 ]</a></span>
either does actually live, or has done so formerly, along
the whole intervening line. I will now enumerate the
species alluded to in the preceding pages and indicate
briefly the habitats which they are known with certainty
to occupy.</p>

<p>I. <i>Atypus piceus</i>, Sulzer (ex Simon). The builder
of the tubular nest the silk lining of which is
figured at A in <a href="#Plate_XIII">Pl. XIII</a> It is stated by M.
Simon<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> to be common in all the centre, east, and
west of France, but it remains doubtful whether this
exact form is found in England or not, the true
characters and habits of the English species being
still uncertain.</p>

<p>II. <i>Cyrtauchenius elongatus</i>, Simon, constructing the
funnel type of nest. It inhabits the neighbourhood
of Fez in Morocco.</p>

<p>III. <i>Cteniza Moggridgii</i>, Cambridge (formerly described
under the name of <i>Ct. fodiens</i><a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>), one of the
many builders of a nest of the cork type; I have
hitherto found this spider only at Mentone and San
Remo. It will probably be discovered in shady
valleys in the neighbourhood of Nice.</p>

<p>IV. <i>Ct. fodiens</i>, Camb. (<i>Ct. Sauvagii</i>, Rossi ex
Simon): large nest of cork type; inhabits Corsica. It
has been said that the species found near Pisa (<i>Ct.
Sauvagii</i>) is the same as that which is so common in
Corsica, but it is desirable to have further confirmation
of this.</p>

<p>V. <i>Ct. Californica</i>, Camb.&mdash;Large nest of cork type.
Found near Visalia, about 350 miles south of San
Francisco, by Mr. G. Treadwell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[ 249 ]</a></span></p>

<p>VI. <i>Nemesia c&aelig;mentaria</i>, Latr.&mdash;Nest of cork type.
Only known with certainty to inhabit the neighbourhood
of Montpellier.</p>

<p>VII. <i>N. Moggridgii</i>, Camb. (formerly described
under the name of <i>N. c&aelig;mentaria</i>, Latr.<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>)&mdash;Nest of
cork type; is found at San Remo, Mentone, Cannes,
Hy&egrave;res, and Marseilles. Its range probably extends
some distance to the eastwards, but I doubt whether
it does so towards the west, for there I think it likely
that it will be found to be replaced by the typical
<i>c&aelig;mentaria</i>.</p>

<p>VIII. <i>N. Simoni</i>, Camb.&mdash;Nest of the single-door
unbranched wafer type, discovered at Bordeaux in
May, 1874.</p>

<p>IX. <i>N. suffusa</i>, Camb.&mdash;Nest of single-door branched

<p>XIII. <i>N. meridionalis</i>, Costa.&mdash;Structure of nest
doubtful (see description in <i>Ants and Spiders</i>, p. 138).
Found near Naples and in Ischia. M. Simon has
discovered a spider in Corsica which he considers the
same as that described by M. Costa under the name
of <i>meridionalis</i>, but it seems desirable, in order
thoroughly to establish this conclusion, that specimens
of the spiders and their nests from these distant
habitats should be compared together.</p>

<p>We can scarcely suppose that the real geographical
distribution of the above-named twelve species is as
restricted as it would appear to be from the above
enumeration, and there is little doubt, I think, that
many more habitats will be added in time. Indeed,
our knowledge of the habits and distribution of these
spiders can only as yet be said to be in its infancy,
the whole subject being, for the most part, new and
untrodden ground.</p>

<p>But, it may be asked, what are the chances in the
future for the discovery of undescribed spiders and
types of nests: and what reward of this kind may the
travelling naturalist expect in order to compensate
him for the time and pains which such a search
demands, and which must divert him in a great
measure from making other collections?</p>

<p>The reply is not doubtful.</p>

<p>Europe alone, most probably, contains many trap-door
spiders the specific characters and habits of which
are at present unknown; and as for the warmer
regions of other parts of the globe, we only know
enough to lead us to surmise that still stranger and
more startling discoveries await us there.</p>

<p>Dr. L. Koch's description of the very remarkable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[ 251 ]</a></span>
branched-wafer nest from Australia, alluded to above
(p. 217), and the fragmentary specimens of giant cork-nests
from the same country exhibited at the British
Museum, give us a hint of what the Antipodes will
some day reveal to us; while a stray allusion to a
trap-door nest found near Lake Dilolo, in Southern
Africa, by Livingstone,<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> affords an indication of their
existence in another quarter of the globe. Hitherto
but little importance has been attached by naturalists
to the study of the nests of trap-door spiders, but a
knowledge of their structure is often of the greatest
assistance, and will, I venture to predict, be found to
afford a clue leading to the discovery of many new
species; for it not unfrequently happens that, while
two spiders appear so much alike as to pass for representatives
of the same species, their nests are totally
dissimilar and proclaim them, as in fact they are,
quite distinct from one another. For an example of
this we have only to turn to the seven species of
<i>Nemesia</i>, treated of in the foregoing pages, of which
six construct dissimilar nests, and only two, building
nests of the cork type, make them alike, though the
general resemblance between the spiders themselves
is extraordinarily close. Thus far, indeed, it will be
seen that no two distinct species of European trap-door
spider make wafer nests of the same type,
each kind of wafer nest having its own peculiar
spider.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_158" id="Footnote_158"></a><a href="#FNanchor_158"><span class="label">[51]</span></a> "A large reddish spider (<i>Mygale</i>), named by the natives 'scl&agrave;li,' runs about
with great velocity. Its nest is most ingeniously covered with a hinged cover
or door, about the size of a shilling, the inner face of which is of a pure white
silky substance like paper, while the outer one is coated with earth precisely
like that in which the hole is made, so that when it is closed it is quite impossible
to detect the situation of the nest. Unfortunately the cavity for breeding is
never seen except when the owner is out, and has left the door open behind her."&mdash;<i>Dr.
Livingstone</i>, <i>from</i> "<i>Popular Accounts of Travels in South Africa</i>," chap.
xvii. p. 221.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[ 252 ]</a></span></p></div>

<p>This strikes me as a very curious fact, and I await
with interest the discovery of new species of wafer-building
spiders in order to learn whether this will
continue to hold good or not.</p>

<p>That such discoveries will be made I entertain
no doubt; indeed, I have reason to believe that, even
at Mentone, where perhaps more pairs of eyes have
been at work searching for trap-door spiders than
anywhere else, new species still remain to be detected.
In April, 1873, the surface door of a wafer-nest
together with a very small portion of the tube was
brought to me from the summit of the Aiguille
mountain, near Mentone. I was greatly surprised to
learn that a trap-door spider could live in such a
situation, for the earth on that plateau, which has an
elevation of 4032 feet above the sea, is always frozen
hard for weeks and even months together during the
winter, and snow frequently lingers there. The
spider, therefore, which endures these conditions is
scarcely likely to be of the same species as any one of
those inhabiting the lower country. The trap-door
spiders of these spurs of the Maritime Alps, are
probably of distinct species from those of the plains,
but they are absolutely unknown at present.</p>

<p>Then the males of several species, as, for example,
those of <i>Nemesia Simoni</i>, <i>N. suffusa</i>, <i>N. congener</i>, and
<i>N. Moggridgii</i>, have yet to be discovered; while of
the habits of the males in general we know little or
nothing.</p>

<p>Indeed, there is no one species with the habits of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[ 253 ]</a></span>
which we can say we are thoroughly acquainted, and we
must admit that up to the present time these ingenious
little architects have been at least as successful in
concealing themselves from the intrusion of naturalists
as from the attacks of their proper enemies.</p>

<p>Surely these trap-door spiders, which have lain
quiet in the earth century after century, have hidden
themselves long enough from our inquisitive admiration,
and the time has now come for us to seek them
out and learn their ways.</p>

<p>Adult male length 5<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> lines, length of cephalothorax
3 lines, breadth 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>The cephalothorax is of a short, broad-oval form,
its length being only half a line greater than its
breadth; it is flattened-convex above, and depressed
near the margins, the <i>caput</i> (when looked at in profile)
scarcely rising above the level of the thorax. At the
junction of the caput and thoracic segments is a deep,
circularly-curved indentation, or fovea, the curve of
which is directed backwards; the extremities of this
indentation are continued obliquely forwards on either
side, forming the normal ones which indicate the junction
of the caput and thorax. Rather more than one-third
of the distance between the above curved indentation
and the fore margin of the caput is a very
perceptible and deep but narrow, slightly curved,
transverse indentation which divides the caput into
two distinct parts; the curve of this indentation is
directed forwards. The normal thoracic indentations
are well marked, but not very strong; the surface of
the thorax, though shining, appeared under a lens to
be covered with fine rugulosities. Its colour is yellow-brown;
a large triangular patch on either side of the
caput being tinged with orange, and the rest suffused
with dark brown. The caput is of a dark reddish
yellow-brown, showing (in spirit of wine) two longitudinal
bars, or strong lines, of a clearer orange yellow-brown
colour; its surface is glossy, though, under a lens,
the sides of the fore part are very finely striated or rugulose.
These lines begin behind the extremities of the
hinder row of eyes, and gradually converge to a
point at the thoracic junction; the ocular region and
central longitudinal line of the fore-segment of the
caput have some long and very prominent black
bristles. When alive, the cephalothorax appears to
have been suffused with a purplish hue, corresponding
to that of the abdomen and other parts.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[ 255 ]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>eyes</i> form a rectangular figure, whose fore side
is a little shorter than the hinder one, and whose
transverse, or longest, diameter is as nearly as possible
double the length of its shortest one; the eyes of
the central or fore-central pair are small, and separated
by a diameter's distance from each other. The
hind laterals are the smallest of the eight, and each
is almost contiguous to the hind-central nearest to it,
this latter being of a sub-triangular form, and separated
from the fore-central on its side by an interval
equal to that which divides the two fore-centrals, but
less than that which separates each fore-central from
the fore-lateral on its side. Looked at as in two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[ 256 ]</a></span>
transverse rows of four each, those of the foremost
row are darkish coloured, while those of the hinder
row are pearly white. Omitting the eyes of the hind-central
pair, the remaining three on either side form
as nearly as possible an equilateral triangle.</p>

<p>The <i>legs</i> are long, moderately strong, their relative
length being 4, 1, 2, 3. They are of a dark brown
colour, generally paler on the under sides, furnished
with hairs, fine bristles, and spines; the latter are
numerous and strong beneath the metatarsi and tibi&aelig;
of the first and second pairs; on those of the third
pair they are less strong and more uniformly disposed;
on those of the fourth pair they are fewest and least
conspicuous. The genual joints of the third pair
have some strongish spines on the outer side; the
right leg has eight, the left nine. The toothing of
the superior tarsal claws does not appear to be uniform
on the different legs of the same example; on those of
the fourth pair there were five teeth; on those of the
first pair eight or nine, with two others, quite rudimentary,
towards the point of the claw; and even on one
of the fourth pair of legs one of the claws had six, the
other five teeth. The tarsal claws of the second pair are
toothed throughout nearly their whole length with from
eight to ten teeth; on <i>one</i> of the third pair the teeth
were but five or six, while on the other there were on
one claw but three ordinary teeth and a much stronger
one a little way off in front of them, on the second
claw only a single strong tooth about the middle, and
a smaller one close to its base.</p>

<p>The <i>palpi</i> are long and rather slender, measuring
rather over six lines in length; they are similar in
colour to the legs, and excepting a few&mdash;from twelve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[ 257 ]</a></span>
to fourteen&mdash;short strong spines on the upper side of
the extremity of the digital joint, furnished with hairs
only. The cubital joint is more than half the length
of the radial; this latter is equal in length to the
humeral joint, and nearly as long as the femora of
the first pair of legs. The digital joint is short, of
an oblong oval form, broadest at its extremity. The
palpal organs consist of a nearly spherical corneous
lobe, prolonged at its fore extremity into a long,
slender, tapering, beak-like spine, curving upwards
(<i>i.e.</i>, with its point near to the radial joint), and
inwards.</p>

<p>A broad, conspicuous, shining, corneous band, of a
deeper red-brown than the rest, runs round the middle
(or equatorial line) of the spherical portion of these
organs, covering the greater part of their surface.</p>

<p>The <i>falces</i> are of moderate length and strength,
and of ordinary form. They are similar in colour to
the legs, and furnished in front, chiefly on their inner
edges, with hairs, and at their extremities on the inner
sides, with a few, but not very strong nor conspicuous,
short spines; their under side (along which the fang
lies) is toothed on the inner edge only; the fang is
strong and curved, but presents nothing remarkable
in form, nor could I detect either denticulation or
serration.</p>

<p>The <i>maxill&aelig;</i> are strong, straight, divergent, with a
small prominent point at the inner extremity of each;
they are as strong, but not so long, as the basal (coxal)
joints of the legs of the first pair, of a yellow-brown
colour, furnished with hairs, but with no spines of
any sort or size.</p>

<p>The <i>labium</i> is similar in colour to the maxill&aelig;, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[ 258 ]</a></span>
somewhat quadrate in shape, rounded at the apex; it
is furnished with hairs only.</p>

<p>The <i>sternum</i> is of a sub-pentagonal form, much
broader behind than in front; its colour is dull yellowish-brown,
and it is furnished with hairs, leaving
two largish, bare, round, slightly impressed patches,
not far from each other, in a transverse line near the
middle.</p>

<p>The <i>abdomen</i> is short-oval in form, and very convex
above; it projects a little over the base of the cephalothorax,
and its upper side is of a purplish grey-brown
hue, mottled with a pale dull whitish-yellow, and furnished
sparingly with hairs. The sides and under
side are of a uniform dull whitish-yellow. The
<i>spinners</i> (four in number) are, as usual, of very unequal
size, those of the superior pair longish, strong, three-jointed,
and up-turned, the inferior pair short but
stout, consisting of one joint only and pretty close
together.</p>

<p>The <i>female</i> (as it is conjectured to be) of this
species was described, in the work to which the
present publication is supplementary, from examples
found at Mentone. There is little doubt now but
that it is not <i>Ct. fodiens</i>, Walck., but whether or not
identical with the male above described is not absolutely
certain. I think myself (with Mr. Moggridge,
see <a href="#Page_195">p. 195</a>) that it is so, in spite of some differences
in the relative size of the eyes, the toothing of the
under side of the falces, and the denticulation of
the tarsal claws. With regard to the eyes and
falces, I am not inclined to lay special stress upon
these differences. It is found that in other groups
of spiders whose cephalothorax varies very markedly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[ 259 ]</a></span>
in development in the two sexes, differences of
this nature occur. In the present genus, the male
has an almost flat caput, while the female has a
strongly elevated one; and with respect to the variation
in the tarsal claws, no special weight can be
attached to it in the present instance, since these
claws are not uniformly denticulated in the different
feet of the same individual. Another difference is the
absence in the male of sundry small but distinct
tooth-like spines at the apex of the labium and the
inner corner of the base of the maxill&aelig;; the female
is also wanting in regard to the very characteristic
transverse indentation which divides the caput of the
male into two parts. I can, however, trace in the
female the slightest possible corresponding depression,
scarcely amounting to an indentation, and placed
rather nearer to the junctional thoracic pit.</p>

<p>With regard to the differences between this species
and <i>Ct. Sauvagii</i>, Latr. (<i>Ct. fodiens</i>, Walck.), size alone
would suffice to distinguish them; two females of the
latter now before me measuring 13 lines in length;
while the male (<i>Aran. nouv. ou peu connus du Midi de
l'Europe</i>, par Eug&egrave;ne Simon, M&eacute;m., Li&egrave;ge, 1873)
measures 8 lines (17 mm.) and the female rather over
14 lines (30 mm.), the fore-central eyes in the female
of <i>Ct. Sauvagii</i> appeared to be smaller than those in
<i>Ct. Moggridgii</i> and placed rather farther forwards, but
the eyes in both are otherwise remarkably similar
both in size and position. The males, however,
cannot be confounded inasmuch as, according to M.
Simon, no trace of any transverse indentation on the
caput exists in <i>Ct. Sauvagii</i>.</p>

<p>The denticulation of the tarsal claws in the females
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[ 260 ]</a></span>
of both species is similar, but M. Simon does not
mention this portion of the structure of the male he
describes of <i>Ct. Sauvagii</i>.</p>

<p>The adult male of <i>Ct. Moggridgii</i> above described,
was found behind the stones of an old wall at Mentone,
but not in any kind of nest.</p>

<p>Nest-making, and excavating for that purpose, is,
probably, no part of the work of the adult males in
this and other allied genera, and hence we can see a
reason for differences in the development of the caput,
and the denticulation of the falces. The usual habitat
of the females and their nests is in damp and shady
spots, whereas <i>Ct. Sauvagii</i> constructs its nests in dry
exposed banks.</p>

of the cephalothorax, 5<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>; greatest breadth of ditto, 5;
breadth of fore part of caput, 4 lines; length of caput
rather over 3 lines.</p>

<p>The <i>cephalothorax</i> of this spider is rather broader
in proportion to its length than that of <i>Ct. Sauvagii</i>,
Walck., Sim. = <i>Ct. fodiens</i>, Walck. The convexity, or
elevation, of the caput is also less, but that of the
thorax is greater, so that (when looked at in profile)
the profile line of the two forms a tolerably even and
continuous slope, interrupted only by the thoracic
fovea; the profile, however, of the occiput is curved.</p>

<p>The thoracic fovea, or junctional indentation, is
strong, deep, and semilunar in form, the horns of
the crescent pointing forwards; the other normal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[ 261 ]</a></span>
indentations are well marked, but those which divide
the caput from the first thoracic segment do not unite
with the extremities of the junctional fovea, being
in this respect unlike <i>Ct. Moggridgii</i>, but more like
<i>Ct. Sauvagii</i>. The <i>clypeus</i>, although transversely impressed,
yet slopes forward more gradually than in
either of those species, its breadth is about equal to
that of the ocular area, or amounts to half that of the
facial space. The colour of the cephalothorax, taken
from the specimen preserved in spirit of wine, is a
deep reddish-yellow brown, gradually getting paler
towards the margins. When alive, I understand that
the general colour of the whole spider was a dark
blackish chocolate brown, the legs and cephalothorax
being darker than the abdomen; there are a few
prominent bristly hairs in the medial line both before
and behind the ocular area.</p>

<p>The <i>eyes</i> form a narrow transverse oblong figure,
its length being about two and a half times its width,
and its fore side is a little the shortest; the fore-lateral
eyes are large and oval, and by far the largest of
the eight; the rest do not differ much in size, though
perhaps the hind laterals, which are also oval, are a
little the largest; the longest diameter of these, however,
is less than half the longest diameter of the fore
laterals. The interval between the fore and hind
laterals is small, only equal to the shortest diameter
of the hind lateral; and this interval is nearly double
that which separates each hind lateral and the hind
central nearest to it. The hind laterals and hind
centrals form an almost perfectly straight line, the
former being very slightly indeed within the straight
line of the former; the intervals which separate the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[ 262 ]</a></span>
fore centrals from each other, and each of them from
the fore lateral on its side, are as nearly as possible
equal, though very slightly, if at all, less than that
which separates each of them from the hind central
on its side: the interval which separates the fore
laterals is double the length of the longest diameter
of one of them.</p>

<p>The <i>legs</i> are short and very strong; they are like
the cephalothorax in colour, but paler underneath the
femora; this joint in the third pair is proportionally
much stronger than in the other legs; all are furnished
with hairs, bristles, and spines, a group of
erect bristles among the rest occupies the fore part of
the upper side of the metatarsi of the first and second
pairs; strong spines of different lengths are thickly
placed beneath and on the lower part of the sides of
the tibi&aelig; tarsi and metatarsi of the first and second
pairs. On the tarsi and metatarsi of the third and
fourth pairs similar spines are distributed more uniformly
over the whole surface of the joints, and on
the genual joint of the 3rd pair there is one short
strong spine near its extremity on the outer side,
those on the tibi&aelig; both of the third and fourth pairs
being confined to a few on the outer side, and towards
the lower side only. Each tarsus terminates with
three claws, of which the two superior ones have
a single strong tooth towards the base on the lower
side.</p>

<p>The <i>palpi</i> are rather long, strong, and similar in
colour to the legs. They are furnished with hairs,
bristles, and spines; of the latter the radial and
digital joints have some short and strong ones, pretty
thickly grouped along both their outer and inner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[ 263 ]</a></span>
sides; the digital joint ends with a single untoothed
claw.</p>

<p>The <i>falces</i> are strong and massive, more so than in
<i>Ct. Sauvagii</i>, but of normal form. They are furnished
with hairs and bristles, and with strong spines near
their inner extremities on the upper side; the fangs
are strong, folded along the under side of the falces
in a furrow which is toothed along either edge. The
colour of the falces is a rich deep red-brown.</p>

<p>The <i>maxill&aelig;</i> are strong, straight, divergent, with a
prominent point at the inner extremity, and some
very short, strong, tooth-like spines at their base;
their colour is dull yellow-brown, and, with the labium
and sternum, they are thickly clothed with short
strong hairs.</p>

<p>The <i>labium</i> is dark yellow-brown, tipped slightly
with black; it is of a somewhat semilunar form, and
has a few very short tooth-like spines near its apex.</p>

<p>The <i>sternum</i> is of a rough oval form, broadest
behind and shorter and broader in proportion than
that of <i>Ct. Sauvagii</i> and <i>Ct. Moggridgii</i>; its colour is
dull yellow-brown, and it is destitute of the two
shining bare patches conspicuous in both those
species.</p>

<p>The <i>abdomen</i> is large, short-oval, broadest behind
and very convex above; it is of a dull yellowish-brown
colour, thickly mottled with minute dark points
seen through a lens to be little rings, from the centre
of each of which springs a bristly hair; the underside
is paler; the spinners and spiracular openings are
normal. As observed above, the colour of the abdomen
was rather different in life; it was then of a
deep blackish chocolate brown, with an indistinct
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[ 264 ]</a></span>
longitudinal line along the middle of its fore part on
the upper side, intersected by a similar line at right
angles; but these lines soon disappeared after death;
the specimen had been in spirit of wine some months
before the present description was made.</p>

<p>A single example, with its tubular nest of the cork-lid
type, was received alive from California in 1873,
and appears to have been hitherto undescribed;
though no larger than <i>Ct. Sauvagii</i>, it is yet a
stouter and more massive spider, and may readily
be distinguished by the large size of its fore-lateral
eyes, the narrower ocular area arising from the far
greater proximity to each other of the eyes of each
lateral pair, the less convexity of the caput, and the
greater convexity of the thorax, as well as by its
being altogether a darker coloured spider, and having
shorter stouter legs.</p>

<p>Adult female, length 7 to 9 lines.</p>

<p><i>Cephalothorax</i> oval, truncated and almost equally
broad at each end; the upper surface is moderately
convex, the caput elevated a little above the rest, and
equally rounded on the sides and upper part; the
profile of the whole cephalothorax forms a general
sloping slightly curved line, broken by the thoracic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[ 265 ]</a></span>
junctional pit or fovea, which is narrow but strong,
and gently but equally curved, the convexity of the
curve directed forwards; the thorax next to this
fovea is rather gibbous, but not over any great extent
of surface; the other normal indentations are tolerably
strong; the colour of the cephalothorax is
yellow-brown, darkest on the sides of the caput, and
along the thoracic indentations, palest on the margins,
forming a pale marginal border indistinctly vandyked
on the inner edge. The surface is clothed, but not
densely, with yellowish-grey adpressed hairs; there are
a few black bristles in a straight transverse line, directed
forwards from the lower margin of the clypeus; also a
few more bristles curved and of various lengths before
and behind the ocular area, their points meeting over
this area, and a row of strong, nearly erect ones in a
longitudinal central line from the ocular area to the
junctional fovea; besides these are a few more, finer
and less conspicuous, along the middle both of the
caput and thorax; the colour on either side and in
front of the ocular area is orange yellow-brown, and
joining with this a broad band of the same runs backwards
from the ocular area to the thoracic fovea.
The band begins as wide as this area, it then directly
enlarges a little, and thence tapers slightly and gradually
to its termination, forming a truncate wedge,
with the margins rather irregular, but on the whole
a little curved. This band is not immaculate, there
being two dark yellow-brown tapering lines or bars
along the greater part of its length; these bars begin
from each outer pair of eyes of the hinder row, and
tapering to a fine line, converge to the thoracic fovea,
but do not quite meet. It is important to note the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[ 266 ]</a></span>
exact form and distribution of the central band and
these tapering bars, as their differences from the
character of the similar part in another closely allied
species are strongly specific; the above description
holds good in above twenty examples before me.</p>

<p>The <i>eyes</i> are in two transverse lines, forming an
area whose length is rather less than 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> times its
width; the foremost line is curved, and the curve
directed backwards, the hinder one is also curved and in
a similar direction, but less strongly, looking laterally
the extreme margin of the four eyes of the hinder row
forms a straight line. Considered as in pairs, those of
the fore-central pair are separated by an interval equal
to that which separates each from the fore-lateral and
hind-central nearest to it; the fore-laterals are divided
by about two and a half diameters; they are the largest
of the eight, only slightly however, in some examples,
larger than the hind-laterals. Each of them is separated
from the hind-lateral on its side by not quite
half the diameter of the latter, and each hind-lateral
is very nearly but not quite contiguous to the hind-central
on its side; the hind-centrals are roughly
rounded, smallest of the eight, though in some examples
equal in size to the fore-centrals, and are separated
from the fore-central nearest to it by about one
diameter, which gives a clue to the absolute distance
between the eyes of the foremost pair. The four
lateral eyes are oval, the fore-centrals round; those
of the foremost row are darkish coloured, while those
of the hinder row are pearly white.</p>

<p>Although it is of great importance to observe as
accurately as possible the relative position and size of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[ 267 ]</a></span>
the eyes, yet we must be prepared to find exceptions
to the rule derived from the most exact measurements
in any individual instance.</p>

<p>In the present species the above conclusions, as to
position and size, are drawn from a consideration and
comparison of 20 examples, and are, it is believed,
pretty true, but yet in one example, one of the hind
central eyes was but half the size of the other, and in
another example one of the same eyes was but one-fourth
of that of the other, a mere dot in fact, and the
relative size of the respective lateral eyes of the two
rows do not appear to maintain exactly the same
proportions in all individuals. The height of the
clypeus appeared to be as nearly as possible half that
of the facial space.</p>

<p>The <i>legs</i> are strong, moderately long, their relative
length 4, 1, 2, 3, though in some examples those of the
second and third pairs are equal in length; in others,
those of the third pair are slightly longer than those
of the second; here again, as with the eyes, although
the relative proportion of the legs of spiders is an
important specific point, and in general tolerably
reliable, yet accurate observation and measurements
prove that there are small differences in individual
instances. The legs are yellow-brown in colour, furnished
with hairs, bristles, and a few spines. The
outer sides of the genual joints of the third pair are
destitute of spines; in two instances only out of 20,
this joint had a single, not very conspicuous, spine.
The superior tarsal claws have 4-5 minute pectinations
underneath near their base.</p>

<p>The <i>palpi</i> are moderately long and strong, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[ 268 ]</a></span>
similar in colour and general armature to the legs;
they terminate with a single, strong, sharply curved
untoothed claw.</p>

<p>The <i>falces</i> are of a deep black red-brown colour,
strong and prominent, and flat, but not cut away, on
their inner sides; they are furnished on their upper
sides with black bristles and yellowish-grey hairs,
disposed in longitudinal lines; these bristles are
strongest and most numerous on the inner margin of
the upper side, increasing in strength forwards where,
near the extremity, are some strong spines.</p>

<p>On the inner edge of the under side of each falx is
a row of teeth, and each fang is also denticulate or
finely serrate, beneath towards its hinder part.</p>

<p>The <i>maxill&aelig;</i> are strong, cylindrical, and divergent;
and each has a small bluntish angular prominence at
the extremity on the inner side; their inner margin has
a thick fringe of pale reddish hairs, the fore surface
being clothed (as ordinarily) with dark bristly hairs,
and there are a few black minute tooth-like spines in
a line (sometimes in a small group) near the inner
corner of their base.</p>

<p>The <i>labium</i> is short, broad, its breadth nearly double
its length, and the upper corners rather rounded off;
there are some strongish bristles, mostly towards the
apex, but no tooth-like spines nor denticulations.</p>

<p>The <i>sternum</i> is oval, rather convex, broadest towards
the hinder part, which is pointed at this extremity
but hollow-truncate before.</p>

<p>The <i>abdomen</i> is sparingly clothed with hairs; it is
of a stoutish regular oval form, and of a dull brownish
yellow colour; its fore extremity on the upper side is
thickly blotched with deep blackish-brown, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[ 269 ]</a></span>
whole length spanned by a series of about five curved,
or slightly angular, stoutish bars or chevrons, formed
of more or less confluent, dark, blackish-brown blotches
and markings; a more or less indistinct line of a
similar nature also divides the fore part of the upper
side of the abdomen longitudinally. There is some
variety in the extent, depth, and distinctness of these
markings, but the figures given (<a href="#Plate_XIX">Pl. XIX</a>, p. 229,
figs. B, B 1) show the appearance of an average
example.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that this description is
made from examples in spirit of wine, and that in life
the markings (especially on the cephalothorax) are
often considerably obscured by the hairs on the surface;
when seen through spirit the actual tints of colour
are sometimes misrepresented, but the characteristic
markings are seen more distinctly.</p>

<p>The lower part of the sides and the underside of
the abdomen are of a uniform pale dull brownish-yellow;
the spinners of the superior pair are short,
strong, and 2-jointed; those of the inferior pair are very
minute, and near together at the base of, and almost
between, the others.</p>

<p>Adult and immature females were found in 1873-4
abundantly at Montpellier in France, in unbranched
tubular nests closed at the surface with a close-fitting
"cork" lid.</p>

<p>In <i>Harvesting Ants and Trap-door Spiders</i>, p. 92, a
spider inhabiting similar nests, and found commonly
at <i>Cannes</i> and Mentone was described as <i>N. c&aelig;mentaria</i>,
Latr. The subsequent discovery however of a
very closely allied, but certainly distinct, species in
abundance at Montpellier (the locality in which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[ 270 ]</a></span>
original <i>N. c&aelig;mentaria</i>, Latr., was found) makes it
more than probable that the <i>Montpellier</i>, and not the
Mentone, species is the true <i>N. c&aelig;mentaria</i>. Certainly
as yet no other species more likely than this to be
the one described by Latreille has been found at
Montpellier; in fact, the one here described is the
common one found there, and alone answers to
Latreille's character of having a nest with a lid of
the cork type.</p>

<p>It has become therefore necessary now to record
the Mentone species under another name, and under
that name, "<i>N. Moggridgii</i>" (p. 273) will be noted the
specific differences by which the two species may be
at once distinguished from each other.</p>

<p>The male of the spider here described has not been
yet found. A description is given (p. 276) of a
male spider, <i>Nemesia incerta</i> (no doubt closely allied),
found by M. Eug&egrave;ne Simon at Digne; but reasons
will be given why it is not probable that this Digne
spider should be, as conjectured by M. Simon, the
male of the Montpellier species. Whether the <i>N.
carminans</i> (Latr.) is the male of <i>N. c&aelig;mentaria</i> (Latr.)
or not, is another question, and one surrounded with
some obscurity and difficulty. Latreille described <i>N.
c&aelig;mentaria</i> (female) from Montpellier, and <i>N. carminans</i>
(male) from Aix in Provence; the latter being specially
characterized by a bifid point to the prolongation
of the palpal bulb; L. Dufour appears subsequently
to have considered <i>N. carminans</i>, Latr. (male)
to be the male of <i>N. c&aelig;mentaria</i>, and Latreille
appears to have agreed with L. Dufour upon this,
<i>vide</i> Walck. <i>Ins. Apt.</i>, i. p. 236; but Dufour afterwards
(<i>Ann. Gen. Sc. Phys.</i>, tom. v. Bruxelles, 1820,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[ 271 ]</a></span>
p. 103) introduced an element of confusion into the
question by describing <i>N. carminans</i> as having the
point of the palpal organs simple, "nullement bifid,"
and throwing out a suggestion that it might be the
male of <i>N. Sauvagii</i>, Latr., (= <i>N. pionni&egrave;re</i> or
<i>fodiens</i>, Walck.) Latreille upon this (<i>Vues g&eacute;n&eacute;rales
sur les Aran&eacute;ides, Acad. Roy. des Sc.</i>, 1830, pp. 64,
65) explains Dufour's suggestion as an inadvertence,
but takes no notice of the difference of the form of
the palpal organs as described by him; at the same
time however Latreille explains why, probably, Walckenaer
"still considers (in his <i>Faune fran&ccedil;aise</i>) <i>N.
carminans</i> to be a distinct species." We may conclude
from this that Latreille never altered <i>his</i> opinion
that his own <i>N. c&aelig;mentaria</i> and <i>N. carminans</i> were
the two sexes of the same species; and we shall probably
rightly agree with Walckenaer that Dufour had
another species before him, which he wrongly (l.c.)
described as <i>N. carminans</i>.</p>

<p>Subsequently again a male and female spider, evidently
of one species, were figured by Dug&egrave;s to
illustrate <i>N. c&aelig;mentaria</i> male and female in Cuvier's
<i>R&egrave;gne Animal</i>&mdash;Edition in 20 vols. not numbered
and without date, published in Paris, "<i>accompagn&eacute;e
de Planches par une r&eacute;union de disciples de Cuvier,
MM. Audouin, Blanchard, Deshayes, Aleide d'Orbigny,
Doy&egrave;re, Dug&egrave;s, Duvernoy, Laurillard, Milne Edwards,
Roulin, et Valenciennes</i>." Of these figures, that of the
male has the point of the palpal organs distinctly bifid,
and the nest figured is of the cork-lid type.</p>

<p>On the whole it may be concluded that the male
of the true <i>N. c&aelig;mentaria</i>, Latr., will be found to
have the bifid point to the palpal organs, but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[ 272 ]</a></span>
question cannot be considered settled until further
researches at Montpellier and Aix (in Provence) shall
have furnished <i>males</i> of the <i>N. c&aelig;mentaria</i> now described,
and <i>females</i> of the bifid pointed male&mdash;<i>N.
carminans</i>, Latr.&mdash;for of course it is possible that
Latreille's <i>first</i> views of the distinctness of <i>c&aelig;mentaria</i>
and <i>carminans</i> may be the correct ones.</p>

<p>The characters of the species now described accord
so well with the figures of the female in Dug&egrave;s' plate
(above mentioned) that little doubt can be entertained
of <i>their</i> identity, and if so there would seem to be
little doubt also, but that further research at Montpellier
will reveal a male similar to the male figured
by Dug&egrave;s.</p>

<p>There is but little to add to the descriptions given
(l.c. <i>supra</i>). It must however be noted that the
spines on the outer side of the genual joints of the
third pair of legs, then supposed to be a characteristic
of the present species only, are now found to exist in
several others, with some small exceptions in regard to
number, and also in respect to strict uniformity, on
both legs of the same individual. In <i>N. c&aelig;mentaria</i>
(p. 264), however, there is rarely found even a single
spine on either of these joints; and not one out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[ 273 ]</a></span>
ten examples of another species, <i>N. Simoni</i> (p. 297),
had even one of these spines.</p>

<p>Shortly after the publication of <i>Harvesting Ants and
Trap-door Spiders</i> the male of this species was described
by M. Simon (l.c.) from two examples taken
at Vaucluse near Avignon.</p>

Ants and Trap-door Spiders</i>, (by J. T. Moggridge),
p. 93, <a href="#Plate_VIII">Pl. VIII</a></p>

<p>This spider is exceedingly closely allied to the
foregoing and was thought to be the true <i>N. c&aelig;mentaria</i>,
Latr., until subsequent researches at Montpellier
(the locality where Latreille's types were found)
have resulted in the belief that the Montpellier,
rather than the Mentone species, is that described by
him. At present the females only of the two species
are known, and these may readily be distinguished by
the pattern on the caput.</p>

<p>In the foregoing (the <i>Montpellier Spider</i>) a broad
orange yellow-brown band runs from the ocular area
to the thoracic fovea, tapering gradually to that part,
where it is truncated, forming a wedge with the point
cut off. This wedge-shaped band is charged with two
longitudinal, more or less distinct, dark brown irregularly-tapering
lines, running throughout its whole
length and converging towards each other but not
touching.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[ 274 ]</a></span></p>

<p>In the <i>Mentone Spider</i> there are three orange-yellow-brown
well-defined bars or longitudinal lines between
the ocular area and the thoracic fovea; the central
bar tapers and reaches from the eyes to the fovea, the
lateral ones never more than two-thirds of the distance
from it to the eyes, diverging a little from the central
bar as they run forwards. These two lateral bars are
not straight, <i>i.e.</i>, their margins are more or less
notched or roughly angular, forming in some examples
a line of a somewhat zigzag or bent character. It may
perhaps be observed that when the two dark brown
lines which run along the broad orange-yellow-brown
band on the caput of the Montpellier spider, are well
marked, this also leaves three longitudinal yellow
lines, somewhat similar to those just described in the
Mentone species, but there is this difference even then
(and it is constant throughout a long series of examples),
the lateral lines in the Montpellier spider
<i>always run through to the eyes</i>, equalling in length the
central line, while in the Mentone spider the <i>lateral
bars never reach the eyes</i>, always stopping short of the
ocular area, by one-half, or nearly so, of their length.</p>

<p>Another distinction which appears constant is the
form of the thoracic fovea; in the Montpellier species
this forms a slight but uniform curve; in the Mentone
spider it is more sharply bent at the apex (or
centre of the curve), forming in most examples a
bluntish-angular line.</p>

<p>In the eyes there appears to be but little reliable
difference; if there be any at all constant, it seems to
be that in the present (Mentone) species the fore-laterals
are constantly smaller than the hind-laterals,
and sometimes smaller than the fore-centrals. A close
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[ 275 ]</a></span>
examination, however, of the relative size and position
of the eyes in a series of examples, lowers one's estimation
of the <i>absolute</i> value of this character in the
determination of the species of <i>Nemesia</i>; still it is a
specific character not by any means to be overlooked,
though to be used guardedly, and often with great
reservation.</p>

<p>In regard to other characters and general description
there seems but little to add to the description given
(l.c. <i>supra</i>), except that the labium has no denticulations
at its apex and the outer sides of the genual
joints of the third pair of legs are generally without
spines. Occasionally (in one example out of sixteen)
there is a single spine on this joint, of either the right
or left leg. In this character, however (differing from
several others described below), the Montpellier spider
agrees with that from Mentone.</p>

<p>In both spiders, the fangs of the falces are (in some
instances at least) denticulated. Also in regard to the
relative lengths of the legs, like those of the Montpellier
spider, the second and third pairs of the
Mentone species are not constant in their relative
proportions, though the differences either way are
very slight, and there is often no difference whatever.</p>

<p>The nest and habits of the two species appear to be
nearly, if not quite, similar.</p>

<p>In naming the present species (at the suggestion of
M. Eug&egrave;ne Simon) the writer of these descriptions
gladly testifies to his appreciation of the great value
attaching to Mr. Traherne Moggridge's investigations
of the habits of the closely-allied species of this very
difficult, though most interesting group of spiders.</p>

<p>M. Eug&egrave;ne Simon (<i>Ann. Soc. Ent. Fr.</i> 1873, Bull, c.),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[ 276 ]</a></span>
perceiving the difference between the present species
and the one known to himself as <i>N. c&aelig;mentaria</i>, Latr.,
concludes it to be identical with <i>N. meridionalis</i>, Sim.
Examples, however, of this latter, from M. Simon's
cabinet, show that they are very distinct.</p>

<p>On <i>N. meridionalis</i>, Sim., see p. 289; and on
<i>N. c&aelig;mentaria</i>, Sim., p. 280, M. Simon has, I understand,
subsequently admitted the error of his conclusion,
published l.c. <i>supra</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nemesia incerta</span>, sp. n., <a href="#Plate_XIX">Plate XIX</a>, fig. D, p. 229.</p>

<p>Adult male, length slightly above 4<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> lines.</p>

<p><i>Cephalothorax</i> oval, truncate at each end; moderately
convex above, the profile line forming a pretty
even, sloping, curved line, but flattish in the middle
near the thoracic fovea, which is of a strongly curved
form; the other normal indentations are not strong,
though fairly defined; the colour of the cephalothorax
is yellow-brown, palish and clothed with
yellowish-grey adpressed hairs on the margins, and inclining
to orange on the caput. The clypeus is
somewhat steep, about equal to half the height of
the facial space, and the sides of the caput are
dark blackish-brown, leaving a longitudinal, central
reddish orange-brown band tapering to the thoracic
fovea.</p>

<p>The upper and hinder part of the thorax is
strongly suffused with brown, leaving broad but
irregular pale lateral margins; there is a group of
strong bristles directed forwards from the margin
of the clypeus, and two or three more in the median
line behind the ocular area.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[ 277 ]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>eyes</i> are on a strongish oblong dark brown
transverse tubercular eminence; the fore-laterals are
rather smaller than the hind-laterals, and the fore-centrals
are larger than the hind-centrals, the latter
being much the smallest of the eight; the interval
between those of each lateral pair is about equal to,
or slightly larger than, the diameter of one of the
fore-central eyes; the intervals between the four eyes
of the front row are equal, each interval being equal
to the diameter of one of the fore-centrals; and each
hind-central eye is separated from the fore-central
nearest to it by as nearly as possible a similar distance,
and from the hind-lateral on its side by a very small
but distinct interval.</p>

<p>The <i>legs</i> are rather long, strong, of a brownish-yellow
colour, suffused with blackish-brown on the
upper sides of the femora, and furnished with hairs,
bristles, and spines. Those of the hinder (fourth) pair
were wanting, the relative lengths of the others being
1, 2, 3; 2 and 3 being very nearly equal. The spines
are not numerous, being disposed mostly on the tibi&aelig;
and metatarsi of the third pair; some, however, had
been evidently broken off; all the tarsi were without
spines; each tarsus ends with three claws, the superior
pair with several&mdash;6-8?&mdash;teeth on their under
sides.</p>

<p>The tibial joint of each of the first pair is short, no
longer than the genual joint, but it is strong and
enlarged gradually beneath to its fore extremity,
where it ends in a strong, sharp-pointed, tapering
red-brown curved spine, directed downwards, forwards,
and inwards. Each tarsus of the first and second pairs
is pretty thickly fringed just below on each side along
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[ 278 ]</a></span>
its whole length, with short strongish hairs of an
even length.</p>

<p>On the outer side of the genual joint of the third
pair (left leg) are three spines in a longitudinal row;
the other leg of this pair was wanting.</p>

<p>The <i>palpi</i> are moderately long, and similar in colour
and general armature to the legs; the radial joint is
strong, a little tapering forwards, and somewhat curved
underneath towards its hinder part; its length is about
double that of the digital joint, and from its fore
extremity on the upper side, three strong, somewhat
sessile, spines of equal length, and directed forwards
issue, in a straight transverse line.</p>

<p>The palpal organs consist of a roundish corneous
bulb drawn out into a longish, tapering, curved,
sharp-pointed spine, the point being very fine, gradual,
and directed outwards.</p>

<p>The <i>falces</i> are strong, prominent, of a deep red-brown
colour, furnished above with dull greyish-yellow
hairs mixed with dark bristles, and disposed in longitudinal
stripes; and near the upper extremity on the
inner side are four strongish spines.</p>

<p>The <i>maxill&aelig;</i> are strong, divergent, cylindrical, with
a small angular prominence at their inner extremity;
they are furnished with hairs, but no denticulations,
and there is a strong fringe of reddish hairs on
their inner margins. The maxill&aelig; are of the same
colour as the palpi.</p>

<p>The <i>labium</i> is short and broad; its breadth double
its height and its apex rounded. Its junction with
the <i>sternum</i> appeared to be about at right angles. It is
darker in colour than the maxill&aelig;, but with a paler apex;
its surface is furnished with bristly hairs, but there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[ 279 ]</a></span>
are no denticulations at its apex. <i>Sternum</i> oval,
truncate before, pointed behind, furnished with
bristly hairs, and of the same colour as the legs.</p>

<p>The <i>abdomen</i> is of an oblong-oval form, truncate
before, and tolerably convex above; it is of a pale
dull yellowish colour clothed with yellow-grey hairs,
among which are a good many prominent dark
bristly ones; the fore part of the upper side is irregularly
marked with black-brown; following this towards
the hinder part, and reaching half way or more to the
spinners, is an indistinct longitudinal central line of
the same colour, throwing off numerous short lateral
lines at right angles; towards either side of the hinder
two-thirds of the abdomen are several oblique black-brown
lines extending more or less over the sides;
one, about the middle, extends farther over the sides
than the rest, and almost unites with a curved deep
black-brown transverse line crossing the under side of
the abdomen a little way in front of the spinners.</p>

<p>The under side of the abdomen is similar in colour
to the upper side, and, besides the transverse dark
line above mentioned, there is another touching the
anterior margins of the posterior spiracular plates;
the superior pair of spinners are short and strong;
the inferior pair small, and in the ordinary position,
but apparently not (proportionally) so small as
in the females of some other species.</p>

<p>A single adult male was received for examination
from M. Eug&egrave;ne Simon, by whom it was found at Digne
(Basses Alpes, France). M. Simon conjectures that it
may be the male of <i>Nemesia Moggridgii</i> (p. 273),
but some slight differences in the size and positions of
the eyes, and in the pattern on the cephalothorax, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[ 280 ]</a></span>
on the under, as well as the upper, side of the abdomen,
lead me to believe that it is of a different, and hitherto
undescribed species, though probably very closely
allied to some others, especially to <i>Nemesia Manderstjern&aelig;</i>
(<i>N. meridionalis</i>, Cambr., described, p. 283); in
the present species however the hind-lateral eyes are
much larger in proportion than in <i>N. Manderstjern&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p>Adult male, length 5<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> lines to 6 lines.</p>

<p>M. Eug&egrave;ne Simon (l.c.) describes, as <i>N. c&aelig;mentaria</i>,
Latr., both sexes of a spider found by himself in
the Pyrenees and Spanish mountain regions.</p>

<p>Languedoc and Provence are also given as localities,
but it is not clear that he has himself found it in these
latter parts, certainly not the male.</p>

<p>Two examples of this sex, found in the Pyrenees,
and received from M. Simon, are now before me; these
correspond, so far, very exactly to the description he
gives (l.c.); the female I have not seen.</p>

<p>If the position assumed (p. 271) on Latreille's
own authority, that the true male of <i>N. c&aelig;mentaria</i>,
Latr., (<i>N. carminans</i>, Latr.), has a bifid point to the
prolongation of the palpal bulb, it is clear that the
present species is distinct from that of Latreille.</p>

<p>M. Simon describes this palpal bulb as having its
extreme point "simple et plus effil&eacute;e" (<i>i.e.</i> more
slender than in the preceding species he has described
<i>N. meridionalis</i>). That the examples now before me,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[ 281 ]</a></span>
agreeing exactly with this description, are not the males
of the species above described by myself as <i>N. c&aelig;mentaria</i>,
Latr., from numerous females found at Montpellier,
appears to me clear, not only because I assume that
of the true <i>N. c&aelig;mentaria</i>, Latr., males will be found to
have the point of the palpal bulb bifid, but because the
position of the eyes is markedly different in M.
Simon's Pyrenean males and the Montpellier females.
In the latter the eyes of the front row are separated
from each other by equal intervals, in the former
the interval between those of the central pair is very
perceptibly greater than that between each and the
lateral of the same row nearest to it. The interval
also between each of the fore-central eyes and the
hind-central on its side is proportionally much less.</p>

<p>It appears therefore necessary to characterize <i>N.
c&aelig;mentaria</i> (Sim. l.c.) by some other name, for if
eventually it should be found that Latreille has erred in
<i>N. carminans</i> (with the <i>bifid point</i> to the palpal bulb)
being the male of his <i>N. c&aelig;mentaria</i>, and that the
Montpellier species has a male with a <i>simple point</i>
to this part, even then the present spider cannot retain
its name (<i>c&aelig;mentaria</i>), being distinct from the
females found at Montpellier.</p>

<p>It is possible, of course, that the present species
may hereafter be found, perhaps abundantly, at Montpellier;
in that case it will have to be decided which
of the two is most likely to be the species described
by Latreille. In that eventuality it seems to me
that the spider, above described from Montpellier,
would be more probably Latreille's species, for one
of its specific characters is a tolerably distinct and
bold series of, not more than, five dark angular bars
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[ 282 ]</a></span>
along the middle of the upper side of the abdomen,
agreeing exactly with Dug&egrave;s' figures in the <i>R&egrave;gne
Animal</i> of Cuvier, quoted above (p. 271); while in
M. Simon's Pyrenean spider, the abdominal pattern
of the female described by him, does not agree with
this: "il est orn&eacute; d'une fine ligne noire longitudinale,
un peu ondul&eacute;e, pr&eacute;sentant de nombreuses ramifications,
s'&eacute;tendant sur les parties lat&eacute;rales" (l.c.
p. 26). The males before me accord with this description,
though (as M. Simon also remarks) the "s&eacute;rie
de fins accents bruns transverses" is "peu visibles et
souvent effac&eacute;s" (l.c., p. 25); in one example this
pattern is fairly distinct, in the other it is scarcely
recognisable.</p>

<p>The present is a larger spider than <i>N. incerta</i> (the
male found by M. Simon at Digne); it is also less
distinctly marked both on the cephalothorax and
abdomen. The position of the eyes is different, and
so also is the palpal bulb; in that species the spine
describes a simple curve with a strong outward direction;
in the present it is slightly but perceptibly
<i>sinuous</i>, and its general direction is <i>parallel to the
radial joint of the palpus</i>; the spines also at the
upper fore extremity of the radial joint are 5-6 in
number instead of three. The outer side of the genual
joint of each of the legs of the third pair has three
spines; that on the left side, however, of one example,
has four. The palpal bulb also appears to be proportionally
smaller than that of <i>N. dubia</i>, or of <i>N. Manderstjern&aelig;</i>,
Auss. (<i>N. meridionalis</i>, Cambr.)</p>

<p>Another difference may here be noted between the
present species and the Montpellier <i>c&aelig;mentaria</i>. M.
Simon (<i>in lit.</i>) separates his <i>N. c&aelig;mentaria</i> from all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[ 283 ]</a></span>
others by the length of the patella and tibia (genual
and tibial joints) of the fourth pair of legs, exceeding
in length that of the cephalothorax and falces.</p>

<p>This character has not been found to exist in
several females of the Montpellier species, minutely
measured by Mr. Moggridge; in them the length of
the cephalothorax and falces were found to exceed
that of the genual and tibial joints of the fourth pair
of legs, by from 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> to 2 mm.</p>

<p>In regard to the relative length of the legs of the
present species this was 4, 1, 2, 3 in the one example
examined, and 4, 1, 2-3 in the other, both being
males.</p>

<p>It is a matter of regret that nothing, as yet, has
been accurately observed in regard to the particular
type or form of the nest of <i>N. dubia</i>.</p>

<p>Since the publication of the description of <i>N.
meridionalis</i>, Cambr. (&#9792; l.c. <i>supra</i>), I have had an
opportunity of examining an adult example of each
sex of a <i>Nemesia</i>, described about the same time by
M. Eug&egrave;ne Simon as <i>N. meridionalis</i>, Costa, in <i>Aran&eacute;ides
nouv. ou peu connus du Midi de l'Europe</i>, p. 21
(separate copy). The species described by M. Simon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[ 284 ]</a></span>
was found by himself abundantly in Corsica. He also
gives Italy and Provence as localities, but the former
of these two is, I conclude, given as being <i>Costa's</i>
locality for the spider described by this latter author
in <i>Fauna d. Regn. Napl. Arachn.</i>, p. 14; the other
locality (Provence) would seem to have been doubtfully
given. On careful examination of the Corsican
examples (male and female), and on comparing them
with the male and female of <i>N. meridionalis</i>, Cambr.,
as well as the description and figure given by Costa, I
feel no doubt but that M. Simon is right in according
to the Corsican species M. Costa's name&mdash;<i>meridionalis</i>.
It agrees, I think, decidedly better, on the whole,
with Costa's figure and description than the species
to which (l.c.) I had allotted the specific name <i>meridionalis</i>
conferred by that author. Nor had I any
hesitation in accepting the determination made by
M. Simon, in <i>Bull. Ent. Soc. Fr.</i>, 1873, s&eacute;r. v. tom.
3, c.; that my <i>N. meridionalis</i> &#9792; is the female of
<i>N. Manderstjern&aelig;</i>, Auss., the more especially as
since the publication of my description I have
received from the same locality (Mentone) not
only the male of the spider described by myself
(l.c.), but also the type of M. Ausserer's description
of <i>N. Manderstjern&aelig;</i> (found at Nice), and
believe these to be identical in species. There is,
indeed, a difference in the, apparent, relative positions
and colour of the eyes of the two spiders, but no more
than may be well accounted for by the condition of
M. Ausserer's type (most kindly lent to me for examination
by its owner, Dr. Ludwig Koch); this
example is much shrunken, having the appearance of
having been allowed to get dry and then to have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[ 285 ]</a></span>
again immersed in spirit. This would (I have
frequently found it so in other spiders) cause even
the hard integument of the cephalothorax to contract,
and so cause the eyes to shrink up together into a
closer group, as well as to sink down into the cuticle,
making some of them appear smaller than they
really are. Alternate drying and wetting again in
spirit would also account for the yellowish brown
colour of the eyes, whereas in the male of the Mentone
spider the eyes of the hinder row are pearly grey, and
of the front row dark grey. Beyond these differences
I can find no distinction between them.</p>

<p>The male of the present species is very nearly
allied to both <i>N. incerta</i> (p. 276) from the Pyrenees,
and <i>N. dubia</i> (p. 280) from Digne, of both of which,
as remarked (l.c.), the male sex alone is known to
me; it is, however, larger than either, more richly
coloured, and more distinctly marked. In all three
species the elongated portion of the palpal bulb has a
simple point, but in the present spider it is not drawn
out so finely and gradually: some portion of its
extremity being, though very fine yet really, cylindrical,
and not tapering off into a hair-like termination;
the general direction of the palpal bulb is parallel
with the radial joint, but the point which is equally
curved is directed outwards and a little downwards;
the radial joint has four spines at the fore extremity
on the upper side (in one of the examples there were
however seven on the radial joint of the right palpus),
and the genual joint of each leg of the third pair, in
both examples from Mentone as well as in M. Ausserer's
example from Nice, has three spines on its outer
side. This character was not remarked upon in the description
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[ 286 ]</a></span>
of <i>N. meridionalis</i> &#9792; (Cambr. l.c.). It is not
invariable in a long series of female examples; occasionally
one is found with four spines on one of these
genual joints, in others there is occasionally but one
spine and sometimes (but rarely) none; perhaps in this
case broken off? I am inclined to attach some importance
as a specific character to the number, presence,
or absence of these spines on the outer side of the
genual joint of the third pair of legs; not that it is an
invariable character, few, if any, specific characters are
absolute and invariable, nor that it is of more importance
than the armature of other portions of the different
legs, but as being more easily observed and
less liable to injury than the larger and more numerous
spines on other parts. Equally useful in
specific determination are the spines at the fore-extremity
on the upper side of the radial joint of the
palpus. This, however, applies only to the male,
whereas the character derived from the spines on
the genual joints of the third pair of legs applies to
both sexes.</p>

<p>Another character by which the present species
(&#9792;) may be distinguished from <i>N. dubia</i> (<i>N. c&aelig;mentaria</i>,
Sim.) is that the former is rather narrower
at the fore-extremity of the caput, which is also less
elevated, being almost equally level with the thorax.</p>

<p>The description of the female given (l.c. <i>supra</i>)
needs but little addition. It may be noticed, however,
that the central longitudinal tapering orange
band on the caput is faintly continued to the extreme
hinder margin of the thorax, and the thoracic fovea is
rather sharply curved. The intervals between the
eyes is the same as in those of <i>N. Moggridgii</i>, though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[ 287 ]</a></span>
their absolute size in some examples appeared to be
smaller. In both sexes there are several small, black,
tooth-like, tubercular spines on the inner side of the
base of each maxilla, but none at the apex of the
labium.</p>

<p>The colour of the <i>cephalothorax</i> in the male is
bright-reddish orange-yellow; a large portion of the
sides of the caput, and the ocular area also, is black-brown;
the middle of the thorax is distinctly marked
with black-brown lines radiating to the thoracic
fovea.</p>

<p>Other, less deep, brown markings are mixed with
these radiating lines; there are a few prominent
bristles in front of the ocular area, a single longitudinal
line of erect bristles along the middle of the
orange band from the eyes to the thoracic fovea,
and the whole cephalothorax is more or less clothed
with greyish-yellow adpressed hairs.</p>

<p>The <i>falces</i> are of a deep blackish red-brown colour,
longitudinally striped with yellow-greyish hairs mixed
with dark bristles; and there are some strong spines
at the fore extremity on the inner side.</p>

<p>The <i>abdomen</i> is oval, tolerably convex above, of a
dull, pale, straw colour, suffused with brown at its
fore extremity, whence an indistinct central longitudinal
band tapers to a point rather more than half
way to the spinners; on either side of this band
are some oblique, lateral, brown lines, which become
broken chevrons, between the termination of the
central band and the spinners. The sides are
obscurely and irregularly marked with brown, and
the under side is of a uniform dull straw-yellow; the
abdomen is clothed thickly with mixed yellow-grey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[ 288 ]</a></span>
and dark hairs; the upper side is furnished also with
strong, nearly erect bristly black ones.</p>

<p>Each <i>tarsus</i> terminates with three claws; those of
the superior pair are pectinated beneath, but the
number of teeth appears to vary in the different legs,
from six to eight. The tibial joint of the first pair
is of the same character as that in the males of other
species: it has a strong black curved spine directed
inwards from the fore extremity of the under side,
and a short bluntish-conical, but very distinct prominence
at the same extremity on the inner side, not
far from the base of the curved spine, <a href="#Plate_XX">Plate XX</a>,
fig. B 4 and C; the colour of the legs is yellow,
tinged with orange, the upper sides of the femora
being nearly black; the palpi are similar in colour,
the upper side of the humeral joints being suffused
with a blackish hue.</p>

<p>The relative length of the legs is not constant; in
one example it was 4, 3, 1, 2, in the other 4, 1, 2, 3,
2 and 3 being very nearly equal. Similar variations
are also found in the legs of the female.</p>

<p>In regard to the nest of this species, researches made
subsequently to the publication of <i>Harvesting Ants and
Trap-door Spiders</i> have proved it to be of rather a
different form from that there represented; thus in
the main tube, just before the inner door is reached,
there is a descending branch running off from the
main tube at the same angle as the ascending branch,
but in an opposite direction; in the older and larger
nests the descending branch becomes choked with
d&eacute;bris; it is more distinct in the nests of the younger
spiders, and is always more or less distinctly traceable.</p>

<p><i>N.B.</i>&mdash;In the above details there have been only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[ 289 ]</a></span>
one or two special distinctions observed between the
two male examples examined. It should however be
noted that in one (the one captured behind a stone
wall) the ocular area was slightly narrower in proportion
to its length, and the interval between the eyes
of each lateral pair rather less.</p>

<p>The examination of an adult example of each sex
of this spider received from M. Simon, by whom they
were found in Corsica, leads me to conclude that we
have here the true <i>N. meridionalis</i>, Costa, as certainly
at least as it is possible at present to identify the
species by the insufficient description and figures
given by this author.</p>

<p>The <i>eyes</i> appear to be less closely massed together
than in <i>N. Manderstjern&aelig;</i>, but in other respects no
particularly tangible difference is to be noted; the
interval however between the eyes of each lateral pair
is perhaps rather greater. Between the male and the
female of the present species there is a decided difference
in the relative position of the eyes. In the
female the fore-centrals are nearer together than each
is to the fore-lateral on its side, while in the male, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[ 290 ]</a></span>
fore-centrals are wider apart than each is from its fore-lateral.
I have also noted a similar difference in
regard to <i>N. Manderstjern&aelig;</i>. The fore-centrals are
also smaller in the female than in the male.</p>

<p>The two species, although bearing such great general
similarity to each other, may be at once distinguished
by several very tangible differences. First in regard
to the <i>male</i>. The <i>cephalothorax</i> of <i>N. meridionalis</i> has
the whole caput of an almost uniform dark brown
colour, two slender yellow lines beginning, one a little
way behind each lateral pair of eyes, and converging
rather quickly towards each other, run on nearly
parallel, but in close proximity together to the
thoracic fovea. The centre of the thorax is
also dark brown, the brown portion formed by radiating
confluent patches, rather than by distinct lines as
in <i>Manderstjern&aelig;</i>. The curve of the thoracic fovea is
sharp, in fact more in the form of a straight line with
the ends bent down.</p>

<p>The <i>cephalothorax</i> is of nearly one uniform level
and convexity above; the caput being a little more
rounded than the thorax; the eye eminence seemed
to be rather higher than in <i>N. Manderstjern&aelig;</i>, and
the <i>clypeus</i>, which is steepish, is impressed in the middle
and exceeds in height half that of the facial space;
on the lower margin of the <i>clypeus</i> is a transverse row
of several strong prominent bristles. There were no
bristles behind the eyes, and no appearance of any
having been broken off there (the female, however,
has a single longitudinal row on the caput). The
lateral and hinder margins of the cephalothorax, however,
are, in the male (but not in the female) clothed
with black bristles and bristly hairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[ 291 ]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>palpi</i> are longer than in <i>Manderstjern&aelig;</i>. The
radial joints have, at the upper fore extremity of each,
five spines, <i>three</i> in front in a transverse line, and <i>two</i>
immediately behind them. The palpal bulb is more
globular, and the spiny production, which is not very
long, springs from it more suddenly, and is <i>strongly
sinuous</i>, its sharp tapering point directed outwards.
The strong sinuosity of this part distinguishes it at
once both from <i>N. Manderstjern&aelig;</i> and all other known
European males with a simple point to the palpal
organs.</p>

<p>The <i>legs</i> are longish and strong; their relative
length 4-1, 3, 2 (male); 4-1, 2, 3 (female); they are
furnished with hairs, bristles, and spines. These do
not appear to call for special notice, except that each
genual joint of those of the third pair has two spines
on its outer side in both sexes.</p>

<p>The superior tarsal claws are denticulated, but the
denticulations differ in number and strength, not only
in the two sexes and in the different legs, but in some
instances in the two superior claws of the same leg.
The denticulations seemed to be more numerous in
the female than in the male.</p>

<p>The <i>abdomen</i> is elongate oval, and of a straw yellow
colour. In the <i>male</i> the fore part of the upper side
is irregularly black brown, followed by an irregular
somewhat broken longitudinal central bar, and some
broken oblique lines and portions of chevrons. In the
<i>female</i> the fore part is less densely blackish, the
central longitudinal line is obscure, but the oblique
lateral lines are more distinct and less broken, but
none are quite united so as to form chevrons, though
the two or three nearest to the spinners almost do so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[ 292 ]</a></span></p>

<p>The upper side is furnished with numerous strong
nearly erect black bristles.</p>

<p>The <i>labium</i> has a row, of bristles only, at its apex.</p>

<p>The markings of the cephalothorax in the female
are very nearly like those of that sex in <i>N. Manderstjern&aelig;</i>;
the tapering orange yellow band, however,
behind the eyes appears to be rather bolder, as in
that species this band also is faintly traceable quite
to the hinder thoracic margin. The inner corner of
the base of the maxill&aelig;, in both sexes, has several
minute tooth-like black spines.</p>

<p>The form of the cephalothorax in the female differs
from that of the male; in the latter sex (male) it is
narrower before and rather rounded behind; in the
former sex (female) it is broadest before and more
distinctly hollow-truncate behind; the caput is also
rounder and more elevated. In the female the tarsi
and metatarsi of the two first pairs of legs have close
set brush-like hairs beneath; these are wanting in the
two hinder pairs, and also almost entirely wanting
on the two first pairs in the male.</p>

<p>Various other characters, both peculiar and differential,
are noted in regard to this species by M.
Simon (l.c.). It is to be regretted that this painstaking
observer did not note more exactly the form
and type of its nest; from his description of it, however,
it appears to be branched, but whether the door
is of the wafer or cork type, or whether it has an inner
door or not, is not mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nemesia Congener</span>, sp. n., <a href="#Plate_XVIII">Plate XVIII</a>, fig. A,
p. 225.</p>

<p>Adult female, length 9 lines (19 mm.).</p>

<p>In general appearance, colours, and markings this
spider bears great resemblance to <i>N. c&aelig;mentaria</i>.
The eyes, however, appeared to be smaller, and the
hind-centrals also smaller in proportion to the rest.
The pale margins of the cephalothorax are in the
present species generally confined to some rather indistinct
pale patches.</p>

<p>The central orange band from the eyes to the
thoracic fovea is, especially in immature examples,
often only a simple tapering line; in others it is larger,
and often composed of three converging narrow orange
bands, which form, in some examples, a broad central
tapering band, marked with two longitudinal dark
lines. The thoracic fovea is curved, but not sharply.</p>

<p>The <i>abdomen</i> is broadish oval, of a dull clay colour,
marked with dark brown lines, and markings on the
sides and upper side. In some examples these form a
longitudinal central series of curved or slightly angular
lines; in others but little trace of regular chevrons
can be seen.</p>

<p>In the present spider there is also a longitudinal
pale yellowish patch on the inner upper margin of the
falces near their base; they are furnished with hairs in
longitudinal bands, and spines, like others of the genus.</p>

<p>The <i>legs</i> are moderately long, strong, and furnished
with hairs and bristles, and, sparingly, with spines.
The genual joints of the third pair have some spines
on the outer side, varying from one to three in different
examples. The tarsi and metatarsi of the first
and second pairs, as well as the radial and digital
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[ 294 ]</a></span>
joints of the palpi, have strong lateral brush-like
fringes of close-set sooty black hairs. The superior
pair of tarsal claws are denticulated, but not uniformly
either in strength, number, or position.</p>

<p>No doubt this will prove a very troublesome spider
to distinguish with certainty from <i>N. c&aelig;mentaria</i>, but
the almost constant presence of a spine or spines on
the outer face of the genual joint of the third pair of
legs seems to be a good distinguishing character; in
no one example out of nine carefully examined could
I detect their absence altogether, while a single spine
even on <i>N. c&aelig;mentaria</i> is rare.</p>

<p>In the present species five examples had three spines
on each of these joints; two had two spines on each;
one had a single spine on each; another had one on
one side, two on the other.</p>

<p>The nest, however, is very characteristic and
peculiar. It is of the wafer-lid type, and so cannot,
from even the outside, be mistaken for that of <i>N.
c&aelig;mentaria</i>, which is of the cork-lid type; it is, moreover,
branched below, while that of <i>N. c&aelig;mentaria</i> is
a single unbranched tube. It has also an inside door,
or valve, of very remarkable construction, having two
perfect cork-like faces, securely shutting off either the
branch, or the main tube just above the branch, at
pleasure. By this latter character it is distinguished
also from the tube of <i>N. Manderstjern&aelig;</i>, as well as by
the absence of a second short branch or cavity, lately
discovered in the nest of this last spider. Examples of
this spider were found, not unfrequently, but invariably
in such nests as that above described, at Hy&egrave;res.</p>

<p>The female sex only has yet been met with.</p>

<p class="pmb2"><i>Habitat.</i> Hy&egrave;res.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[ 295 ]</a></span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Nemesia Suffusa</span>, sp. n., <a href="#Plate_XVII">Plate XVII</a>, fig. A,
p. 215.</p>

<p>Immature female, length 7<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> lines (15<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> mm.).</p>

<p>Although no example was quite adult, this species
may readily be distinguished from all others yet
known to me, by its more elongated form, particularly
the cylindrico-ovate form of the abdomen.</p>

<p>The <i>cephalothorax</i> is oval, broadest towards its posterior
extremity, where it is rounded, the fore-margin
being truncated; the caput is well rounded and convex,
and the thorax perhaps more so than in other species, so
that when looked at in profile there is a considerable
dip or hollow at the thoracic fovea; this fovea forms
a slight curve. Except that the lateral margins are
rather broadly pale towards the hinder part (though
the pale portion is ill-defined), the whole of the cephalothorax
is of a uniform dull yellowish-brown colour;
the extreme lateral margin is marked by a black line,
and in one or two examples there was an indistinct
yellowish central longitudinal line from the eyes to
the thoracic junction, having a single row of prominent
bristles upon it. The whole surface of the
cephalothorax is fairly clothed with dusky yellowish-grey
adpressed hairs: the ordinary grooves and indentations
are well marked.</p>

<p>The <i>eyes</i> are on the usual eye eminence, which is
perhaps rather more elevated than ordinary, and its
summit black; their position is ordinary. It may,
however, be noticed that the fore-centrals are placed
more forward than in most of the other known
species; the fore-centrals are about <i>equally</i> separated
from each other, and from the fore-laterals nearest to
each respectively; they are also separated from the hind-central
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[ 296 ]</a></span>
nearest to each, by an interval not differing
much from that between each other; the hind-centrals
are distinctly oval, or rather somewhat semilunar in
form, smallest of the eight (except in one example,
when they were almost, if not quite, as large as the
fore-centrals), and at their hindermost point very near,
but not quite contiguous, to the hind-laterals. The
eyes of each lateral pair (of which the hinder is very
nearly equal in size to the fore one), are very near, but not
quite contiguous, to each other; the interval between
them is narrower than that between the corresponding
eyes in almost any other yet described species.</p>

<p>The <i>legs</i> are neither long nor very strong; their
relative length is 4, 1, 2, 3, though between 2 and 3
there is in different examples the same variation
observed in other species; sometimes they are equal,
and sometimes one, and then the other, very slightly
the longest: their colour is pale yellowish, and they
are furnished with hairs, bristles, and spines, but the
latter are not numerous, and appeared to be both
longer and slenderer than usual; the genual joints of
the third pair have spines, from one to three on the
outer side, for the most part, three; the superior tarsal
claws are pectinated (but not uniformly on all the
legs) beneath their hinder portion.</p>

<p>The <i>falces</i> are strong, and similar in colour to the
cephalothorax, but they do not appear to call for any
special remark.</p>

<p>The <i>maxill&aelig;</i> have a few minute tuberculiform black
teeth at their base on the inner side, and, with the
<i>labium</i> (which has no hairs at its apex) and <i>sternum</i>,
are similar in colour to the legs.</p>

<p>The <i>abdomen</i> is of an elongated, or cylindrico-ovate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[ 297 ]</a></span>
form, of a dull drab-yellowish colour, with a central,
longitudinal, irregular, rather chocolate-brown bar on
its upper side, and 6 to 7 well-defined lateral oblique
slightly curved lines of the same colour and touching
the central line; between these lines are some other
irregular, but similarly coloured, markings.</p>

<p>The sides are almost immaculate, and the underside
quite so; the spinners are ordinary.</p>

<p>About 10 examples (all immature) were found at
Montpellier in branched tubes closed at the entrance
with a wafer-lid. The branch arises some way below
the entrance and runs up to the surface at an acute
angle with the main tube; there is no lower door,
and thus this tube forms the type of a new form of
nest, being branched, with a wafer-lid, but without a
lower door.</p>

<p>This species cannot be confused with <i>N. c&aelig;mentaria</i>,
which is found abundantly in the same locality;
both the general form, colours, markings, and nest
readily distinguish it from that species.</p>

<p class="pmb2"><i>Habitat.</i> Montpellier.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Nemesia Simoni</span>, sp. n., <a href="#Plate_XVI">Plate XVI</a>, fig. A,
p. 211.</p>

<p>Adult female, length rather more than 9<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> lines
(20 mm.).</p>

<p>This spider is of a proportionally broader and
stouter form than others of the genus <i>Nemesia</i>, and
the cephalothorax (which is entirely glabrous and
destitute of adpressed hairs) has the caput more
rounded and elevated than in any other species of
<i>Nemesia</i> known to me, approaching <i>Cteniza</i> in these
respects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[ 298 ]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>cephalothorax</i> is oval, truncate, and about
equally broad at each end; the ordinary grooves
and indentations are strong; besides the groove
which indicates its union with the thorax, the caput
has an indented or pinched-in appearance towards its
hinder part on each side. Except that this was
present in all the examples examined (ten) it might
have been taken to be accidental.</p>

<p>The colour of the cephalothorax is dark brown
tinged with yellow, darkest on the sides of the caput,
which is divided longitudinally by a narrow, dull,
orange-yellow line, and lightest on the margins
towards the hinder part; the thoracic fovea is curved,
but more deeply indented and the indentation is wider
at each end than in other species, the ends being a
little turned back: there is a single longitudinal row
of long erect bristles along the central line of the
caput, and a few more on the lower margin of the
clypeus.</p>

<p>The <i>eyes</i> form a narrower oblong area than usual,
owing chiefly to their small size and to those of each
lateral pair being almost contiguous to each other,
separated only by an interval equal to that which
divides each hind-lateral from the hind-central nearest
to it. The hind-centrals are smallest of the eight,
and vary in form, being round, semilunar, or roughly
wedge-shaped, differing at times in the same example.
The eye eminence is less elevated than in
most species, and this brings the fore-centrals nearer
to the straight line of the fore-laterals; these last are
the largest of the eight. The height of the clypeus
exceeds half that of the facial space.</p>

<p>The <i>legs</i> are short and strong; their relative length
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[ 299 ]</a></span>
4, 1, 3, 2, or 4, 1, 2, 3, or 4, 1, 2-3; they are of a
brownish yellow colour, deeper on their fore-sides,
furnished with hairs, bristles, and spines, the latter
not very numerous nor unusually strong; there are
no spines on the outer sides of the genual joints of the
third pair; the tarsal claws are longish and strong.
Those of the superior pair have but one, two, or three
pectinations on their underside; on some of the legs
I could not detect any. There seemed to be no more
uniformity in the tarsal-claw pectinations in this
species than in others. The tarsal and metatarsal
joints of the legs of the first pair have a fringe of
close-set short blackish hairs on either side, as also
have the digital joints of the palpi, these being similar
to the legs in colour and armature; the humeral joints
are very deep but narrow, being apparently bent and
hollowed on their inner sides to allow of meeting well
over the falces.</p>

<p>The terminal palpal claw has two teeth towards its
base on the underside. I could not ascertain satisfactorily
whether this is or not a uniform character
in all examples; in one example these denticulations
were very plain, but they seemed to be wanting in
others.</p>

<p>The <i>falces</i> are very strong and massive, round in
their profile, and very roundly prominent near their
base on the upper side. They are of a rich deep
black-brown colour, glossy, and furnished along their
inner margins with black bristles and hairs, and with
strong spines at their extremity on the upper side.
The fang is strong, and the outer margin of the
groove in which it lies when at rest has some strong
teeth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[ 300 ]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>maxill&aelig;</i> are strong, of normal form, but very
convex on their outer surface.</p>

<p>The small tuberculous teeth noticed at the base on
the inner side of the maxill&aelig; of all the other species I
have examined, were visible (though with difficulty)
in this species also.</p>

<p>The <i>labium</i> is broader than it is high, convex on
its face, and rounded at the apex; it is (as also are
the <i>maxill&aelig;</i> and <i>sternum</i>) of the same colour as the
legs, and clothed with numerous strong bristly hairs.</p>

<p>The <i>abdomen</i> is short-oval, and strongly convex
above; it is of a dull clay-coloured brown tinged with
chocolate, and along the centre of its upper side is a
series of six strong angular bars or chevrons of a dark
chocolate-brown colour, and pretty distinctly defined,
though, when examined closely, broken in parts.</p>

<p>The intervening spaces between the angular bars
and the sides have a few irregular markings of a
similar colour; and they are connected by a longitudinal
central line of the same hue running through
their apices.</p>

<p>The abdomen is very sparingly clothed with hairs
and fine bristles; the superior pair of spinners are
strong; those of the inferior pair very small and
short.</p>

<p>Examples of this fine and very distinct spider
were found at Bordeaux in simple unbranched tubes,
covered with a wafer-lid, running down very deep into
the earth, in some cases as much as fifteen inches into
an exceedingly hard soil, making it a work of great
labour and care to get them out without injury.</p>

<p>This species can scarcely be confused with any
other yet known; its short robust form, short legs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[ 301 ]</a></span>
more elevated caput, general dark colour, distinct angular
bars on the abdomen, and almost contiguous
lateral eyes, as well as the form of the nest, will
readily distinguish it.</p>

<p>It is with great pleasure that I connect with this
spider the name of my most kind friend and brother
arachnologist, Monsieur Eug&egrave;ne Simon, to whom I
am so greatly indebted for much information and
numerous examples of rare spiders.</p>

<p>I must not conclude these descriptions without
expressing my sense of obligation to Mr. Moggridge
for so kindly allowing me to add them to the far
more popular, and more interesting, portion of this
volume, in which the <i>habits</i> of these spiders are
recorded.</p>

<p>Descriptions of <i>colour</i>, <i>form</i>, and <i>structure</i> are but
dry details, though very necessary for the determination
of species; and in the present case it is
very important as well as interesting to be able to
conclude with some certainty that differences of type
in the tubular nests of the spiders Mr. Moggridge
has observed so closely and accurately, are joined to
well-marked specific differences obtained from those
other characters above mentioned, and which it has
been my endeavour to detail as fully and faithfully as
possible.</p>

<p><b>NEW SERIES OF NATURAL HISTORY
FOR BEGINNERS.</b></p>


<p><span class="tbhigh">*<span class="tblow">*</span>*</span> A good introductory series of books on Natural History for
the use of students and amateurs is still a <i>desideratum</i>. Those at
present in use have been too much compiled from antiquated sources;
whilst the figures, copied in many instances from sources equally antiquated,
are far from accurate, the colouring of them having become
degenerated through the adoption, for the sake of cheapness, of
mechanical processes.</p>

<p>The present series will be entirely the result of original research
carried to its most advanced point; and the figures, which will be
chiefly engraved on steel, by the artist most highly renowned in each
department for his technical knowledge of the subjects, will in all
cases be drawn from actual specimens, and coloured separately by
hand.</p>

<p>Each work will treat of a department of Natural History sufficiently
limited in extent to admit of a satisfactory degree of
completeness.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

provided that:

        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
